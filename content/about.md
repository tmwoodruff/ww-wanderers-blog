# About

Hi! We are Tammy and Travis from Texas. We enjoy traveling; it is a great teacher. Our favorites are cruising, to see the world one port at a time, and National Parks (with some cities thrown in). 

We are both retired and are finishing raising two sons. One is a Sophomore in college; he is at Texas A&M in the Corps of Cadets with an Air Force ROTC scholarship and is a Chemistry with Biochemistry track major. The other is a Senior in High School, so we are focusing on college applications and scholarships. 

We have big travel plans: our first trip to Asia in 2027; Antarctica cruise; European grand tour – backpacking with wheels and not too many hostels, given our age; a Queen Mary 2 transatlantic crossing; American and Canada National Park tour; etc.; etc. Until then, we take trips when we can.

My love of travel started due to my Aunt. Our first trip was for my 15th birthday when we drove to Austin from our home about an hour north of DFW, about a 4ish hour drive total. She got us a fancy hotel for me to experience. Travis and my first trip together was London. 

Please join me, and I will share future and past trips and pictures.
