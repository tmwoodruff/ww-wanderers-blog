We had a shared group tour booked with [www.puertomontt-excursiones.com/en](www.puertomontt-excursiones.com/en), the original tour link that I had does not exist noq, but this looks to have the same stops: [https://www.puertomontt-excursiones.com/en/tours/ozjora-vulkan-osorno-i-kaskady-petroue](https://www.puertomontt-excursiones.com/en/tours/ozjora-vulkan-osorno-i-kaskady-petroue). The tour provider kept a list of those that had signed up (we did not have to get a group committed or pool money to make one payment -- both were nice to not be in charge of). I did post the tour on our Roll Call after signing up. Some others signed up; we were not all in the same tour. The cost of tour depended on how many were in your group.

In the M&G, we coordinated a time and place to meet with one in each group getting tender tickets. The tour provider provided names and room numbers for those in our group -- if the person agreed to provide that info. For those not in our M&G that we had room numbers for, I called to coordinate or left a vmail.

We got up and met early with an expected 8am arrival. The ship did not make up all the time from the late departure from Valparaíso, so we waited and waited. The crew provided little cups of water and orange juice. Once they began calling tenders, we were all off and met the guide quickly. It was probably 10 or 10:30 am when we met the guide. There was a covered, enclosed area where we did bag check and waited. Our guide directed us to the wi-fi details, so we could check on things back home, while we waited for everyone. There were 2 couples from Canada, one from Scotland, and a family from France. 

After we had our group, we had a group of 16, we went out to board the minibus.

It was also rainy, and I very much wanted to see the Osorno volcano with its conical top like Mt. Fuji.

Our first stop was this church.

Next up, and I believe we got to take a restroom break here, were our wet alpaca friends.

Then we went to the green lagoon.

One more from the green lagoon with my water-proofed husband.

Next, we went to the waterfall. It is running through black lava. It was very beautiful with lots of rain.

The full time our guide kept up optimism that the mountain would come out. I thought he crazy, but look at what is peeking out. Then, clear skies with just one cloud on top.

We stopped at various mountain vantage points as it peeked out.

We stopped at Puerto Varas, a German community. Here we had free time to explore on our own.

Yay -- the mountain was out and a bird

Our guide noted the volcano just got snow the night before. We were on the Pan American highway during the tour.

Then we headed back to port. I forgot that we earlier stopped for lunch before it stopped raining and the clouds cleared. We had empanadas -- beef and chicken. We paid USD for the tour. We collected crisp, unwrinkled and non-written on US dollars before the trip, so that they would be accepted in South America. I organized money needs into port labeled envelopes.

When we got back to the port, we tried a call to the kids over the port wi-fi. It was Saturday, and they had moved to my parent's house. They were gone to McDonalds with my Mom to eat and play. I talked briefly to my Dad, and it was so hard to hear on both sides so would not have been a good call with the kids anyway.

Back on the ship, we had dinner in the MDR; we shared a table with two ladies. I had chicken cordon bleu and volcano cake; Travis had crab and fish cake and a mexican brownie. We played the Majority Rules game and tied for 2nd.

The tour was very good; the scenery was amazing.

One more note on Puerto Montt -- the tour lists an optional trip up the mountain on ski lift, weather permitting. I wanted to do this and mentioned in email to the tour guides. I found the lift's web site, and it was pricy as far as planning money needs. I contacted them from the web site to ask if they took credit cards. They quickly replied that they did. With the weather and late arrival, we did not get the opportunity to go up.
