I learned Patagonia means big foot. I read if the ship docks; then a taxi is required to get to town. We tendered, which was right in town. It was not raining with some sun; it was chilly and windy (we were definitely far south now). We walked up the hill for the view.

Whale tail just outside the terminal -- doh, I got into someone else's picture.

Walking to the hill. Note this statue; one foot is worn. If you rub it, it means you will return to Punta Arenas. I had read about this but did not think about at the time or know it was the statue; until later, I noticed that we had a picture of someone doing it. And a dog here too, even where it gets colder.

The stairs that we climbed up the hill. It was also interesting seeing the car brands that we do not have at home. I'm always slow going upstairs, uphill, up-etc., and Travis loves to get the worst pictures of me from way ahead.

Made it. Art that is a bit overgrown. Great view of the water and ship.

Compass with lots of pad locks of love.

One of these cool sign, but at someone's house. I liked the architecture of this house.

These trees had weird "haircuts". I'm not sure if they could not reach any more, so they just stopped. Some sea lion fountains; they were not on and did not look used lately.

I read about Cafe Inmigrante having very big desserts that we were going to share. We found it; however, they did not open to 3pm. We also originally looked at doing a brewery tour. We emailed the tourist information office; they replied that the time of the tour was 3pm and how to contact the brewery to schedule. This would be cutting it close; we were in port from 7am to 5pm. This town opens late.

Other pictures from walking around town.

Interesting with water after the sand. Art on the buildings. Cormorants on the old pier and the tender in the background.

We did some souvenir shopping; I found an adult and baby penguin magnet. We found jelly made from a berry that our tour guide in Puerto Montt pointed out and said we could try. We also stopped at a grocery store, Umarc, and got a coke zero (yum) and candy to share. We enjoyed them at this green clock that is right at the tender dock.

Next, we went back to the terminal to try the wi-fi. It did not work. Some people were on; one had to wait for a slot to open up to get on. Talking to our kids was not working very well.

We did each get 30 minutes on the ship for platinum. We would write an email offline and jump on to sent them trip stories and say hello.

So, we tendered back.

We had lunch back on the ship and snack with cookies and ice cream at 4pm. My husband had a big salad and pickles, jalapeños, coleslaw, and fruit. Then we played celebrity trivia.

For dinner, we went to Las Rablas, the Spanish bar with complimentary tapas. Husband's food --

My plates. I liked the cream cheese topped ones the best; the others were okay.

We went to the early show where the Illusionist, Cripton, was performing. We had seen him and his assistant/wife perform before; that had some new tricks. It was good.

Then we went back to the restaurant for dessert only. We made it there right before the crowd from the show hit. Husband had the Irish creme pie, and I had the nutella creme brulee. Both were really good. The creme brulee would have been better with a more caramelized head. The choc in the Irish cream was really good. The best creme brulee that I have had, also on a ship, had dark chocolate at the bottom -- yum.

Dessert was quick. After, my husband went to the gym, and I went back to the room to pack for Ushuaia tomorrow.

We have not been guilty of visiting many cruise ship gyms; however, this was a long cruise. I have to say that the gym very much needed airflow! I noticed later the ceiling was too low for ceiling fans; they needed those big corner fans like high school basketball gyms have.
