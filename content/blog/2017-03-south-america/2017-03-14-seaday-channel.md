I noted this day that there were not many activities, so I guess not many activities that we were interested in. I did not make breakfast or lunch notes. So, some general preferences of ours. We had many breakfasts in Moderno where they setup an alternative breakfast venue. They have less selection than the buffet, but it is much less crazy than the buffet. I learned that one had to request hot chocolate packets here; it was not sitting out like at the buffet or Great Outdoors. But, they would give you a packet on request. Later, I saw the packets one day in the Sports Bar. They have small area before entering the Moderno and arcade hallway with some pastries and coffee at breakfast time. I liked the MDR for lunch; my husband liked the India food on the buffet.

Another from our cabin.

We played movie poster trivia with new martini tasting friends. We also spent time watching the pretty scenery from the busy observation lounge (nice forward facing and high deck with an outside area) while sailing through the Strait of Magellan. It was very windy outside the lounge, but people were going out for pictures.

From outside the observation lounge.

We had dinner in the MDR. I had the Caesar salad, a BBQ mix of chicken, bratwurst, and ribs, and my favorite the volcano cake. Husband had this watermelon, shrimp, and mozzarella appetizer (and that is all I noted). Silly picture with the appetizer.

Our second towel animal -- a snail. A pretty cool picture -- still light outside and beautiful channel scenery.
