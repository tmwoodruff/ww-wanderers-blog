We had breakfast in the MDR, sharing a table with a couple from the UK and a couple from Germany. We enjoying sharing a table and meeting new people, especially since travel is normally the topic.

We then went to the cake challenge. My husband wanted to be a volunteer, so acting super excited to be picked. He was teamed up with the Hotel Director, Brian Walters, who we have cruise with before.

Tonight we had Teppanyaki reservations. We booked our specialty dining online before the trip; however, they do not allow Teppanyaki booking before boarding since it has very few seats and few seatings per night. We have not been here before since it does book up quickly. We booked right after boarding, and this cruise had more nights so more oppty. I'm not an adventurous eater, and this was adventurous.

There was a soup and a seaweed salad. I had filet for my meat; the sauces were good. Husband had seafood. For dessert, I had green tea cake and green tea ice cream. Both interesting. The ice cream was not bad; I guess ice cream is just good. I did not like the cake; husband did. Husband had fruit sashimi.
