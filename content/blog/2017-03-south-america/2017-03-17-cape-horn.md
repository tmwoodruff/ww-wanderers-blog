We heard that Cape Horn arrival would be early, so we set our alarm for 7:15 (in my older age, this does not sound early--hehe) and turned on the TV. Soon after the cruise director started announcing the Horn arrival. We briefly saw it out the window and then lost it. We quickly got dressed and bundled up. Then he announced that it was visible on the starboard; doh -- after picking the port side. We went outside to the promenade deck and took pictures.

Chilean Navel Station on the left and the albatross sculpture on the right. The albatross sculpture is two metal panels that look like an albatross when viewing at the correct angle. We also saw the lighthouse.

The little hill in the front is the Southernmost point of Cape Horn.

We are now back to the Atlanta, and our blue or turquoise wake is back.

It was also St. Patrick's Day; the ship was already decorated with festive, though cheesy, decorations.

We were lucky and had a very calm Cape Horn visit.

After visiting the Horn, we went back to the room to properly get ready and then to breakfast.

We went to the Sun Fair (ship name: NCL Sun). They had signage advertising it at all the restaurants around the ship, so the night before at Cagney's I had asked what it was. It was around 11am and in the Four Seasons MDR. I was impressed with it. Each ship department had a booth. Maybe this is the replacement for the Chocoholic Buffet -- which also had cool chocolate and ice sculptures?

Some departments were also selling their wares.

Behind, there was a video showing how not to clean the oven, where it exploded into a fire ball.

Side note, on this cruise, the ship had multiple half price sales, maybe since it was almost the end of the South American season. I got a t-shirt in the gift shop toward the beginning of the cruise for half off. Then later got another t-shirt and penguin mug in the atrium sale. These sales could be crazy crowded, but they also worked late into the night (late for us -- until at least 10pm) when not as many people were stopping by.

Next, we were off to lunch in the MDR. Today was the good menu. I had the calamari, fish and chips, and peanut butter cup cheesecake. Yum! Husband had the crab salad, a big salad, and oranges with sherbet. While we were eating, an albatross and later joined by another was flying around, following our wake, all through lunch. The couple we rode with in Ushuaia was at a table near. Since she was disappointed at not seeing beaver, I went over to be sure she got to see the albatross. An albatross -- soooo "Cape Horn" :).

Then, it was on to the Cape Horn "holy" water ceremony. The tradition is that sailors who successfully crossed Cape Horn had the Horn water poured over their head. Our ship collected this water earlier, and now people are lined up to get wet.

My husband opted to wear his raincoat, so the Cruise Director decided to pour the full bowl over him. It was supposed to be one ladle full instead. 

ADD VIDEO

To conclude our Cape Horn day, we had dinner in the Four Seasons MDR. I had teriyaki chicken skewers (which I recall being very good), sirloin Chimichurri (I do not think that I liked this as well), and my usual volcano cake. Husband had spinach soup, turkey, and blueberry pavlova (he said the dessert was very good, and pavlova is like a meringue. I wrote the name down but did not remember what it actually was).

After dinner, we walked the promenade deck. When we was dark (sunset was scheduled for 8:21 pm), we went up to the very top, front deck. We had printed Southern Hemisphere star maps and installed a skymap app before arriving. This was the first clear day. We found Jupiter, Orion, and the Southern Cross. It was very windy up there, and I found it a little scary :). Though good for viewing stars.
