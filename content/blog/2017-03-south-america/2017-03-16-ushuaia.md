This was our first stop in Argentina. This was our first dock (non-tender) port on this cruise. We were in port from 10am to 6pm. We had plans to go in on a rental car with a couple from Atlanta and a lady from the UK. The couple was brave and rented cars frequently in cruise ports. We met our group near guest services. They remembered to get our passports since the cruise line held them on this cruise (first time that we had ever experienced this; though with the slow passport/immigration in Russia maybe this was better. Though Russia probably would not have allowed it), so we could have them stamped at the end of the world post office. Ours came out slowly. With passports all collected, we were off.

A few pictures from the ship first.

We had plans to go to the national park -- Tierra del Fuego (means Park of Fire) -- to visit the end of the world post office and do some hiking. We walked to the rental car place. Before arriving, we found an ATM; we needed Argentina pesos. My money needs document or my interpretation of it at the time failed me. I had my husband get 300 pesos. The national park cost 350 per person -- eek. It was more than any of us expected, but I should have gotten the cash needs correct. The couple we were with had preordered cash and loaned us money to get in. Their cash need planning included Iguazu Falls post-cruise, so we wanted to get back to the ATM after to pay them back in Pesos. We found the car rental place; there was another customer or two ahead of us. They seemed slow at renting cars out here, but it worked out.

Some pictures walking from the port to the car rental office.

Entering the park; after this, we went through the pay booth. They gave us maps, which were a little hard to interpret. We stopped at the visitor center after, but there was not much there. So, we went on. We drove to the other end of the park. Map and park information.

This was at the end of the road where we parked and began hiking. The parking was very full, and there were frequent large coach bus traffic jams.

I loved this rock!

Boardwalk for part of the hike.

Beautiful lake view; someone noted there was penguins (pretty far away). Though with binoculars, we did not see anything. Snow-covered mountains.

The very photographed sign; it is hard to get a turn at the sign.

Lake view from the other side. Waterfall and kayakers.

We hiked to the beaver dams. We could see the dams but did not find any beaver. We thought we found some further away, but with the binoculars, they were just ducks.

After the hike, we drove to the end of the world post office. It is back toward the beginning of the park and was a turn off to the right when heading back.

Look -- we are here!

We got family March birthday postcards, one for our babysitter's house, and one to ours (to know if they arrive). Our group patiently waiting while we addressed each. I also got my passport stamped (3 USD, I believe). I'll take a picture of it to share later. With 6 postcards, stamps to the USA, and the passport stamp, it was about $25. A little pricy, but fun for people to receive. They did not seem to give the best exchange rate, so if you have Argentinian Pesos, you should be better off. Mailing them.

Here is our postcard to us. My passport stamp. I showed it to a coworker later, who noted that this was the ultimate self-promotion -- a sticker with your, the postmaster general, picture added to everyone's passport who buys the passport stamp.

The end of the world post office.

View on the drive back.

After visiting the post office, we headed back into town. We had to fill up (gas) the rental car. There was a line, and it was full service only. The gas cap was on the wrong side of the car to the side we were entering. We thought; doh, they will be upset. When it was our turn, they were able to get the hose to reach. It did not take much to fill it up, and we were on our way. When we got back to the rental car agency, they were not open yet; when they said return it at 4pm, they meant "and not before". We visited while waiting. One person came back and asked us something; it sounded like he would call the owner. A little later the owner came.

We headed back to the port to find the same ATM. It was now locked; something came down to block one from putting the card in. It must have run out of money. We read this could be an issue. Here there was only one machine. We broke off from the rest of the group to look for another ATM. We got into a neat area with shopping. I saw this Hard Rock that I thought looked really cool. I have a Hard Rock shot glass collection; that I honestly have not been adding to lately. So, I had to snap this picture.

Continuing the hunt with no luck, we darted into this store that I have no idea what their business was. It had partitioned desk areas, but no computers. Maybe an internet cafe where you bring your own device??? The guy working there was very helpful and pointed us toward a mall. Success; we got enough to pay back the loan and for the rest of our time in Argentina.

After, we headed back to the ship.

More shots from the ship before we sailed away.

Ushuaia was very beautiful and friendly. I'm ready to go back. (Though, I read an Antartica review preparing for this trip -- hey, they had Antartica and S. Amer combo; what could I do but read both -- and that is on my list now too, with Ushuaia as a common departure town.)

We also tried the wi-fi at this port with no luck.

Back on the ship at 4pm; we had lunch in the form of cookies and ice cream. Then we got ready for dinner at 7pm at Cagneys. Our attempt at a selfie.

I had the Mexican Caesar, and husband the shrimp cocktail and iceberg wedge salad. For the main, I had the Filet mignon with gorgonzola crust (though it was on the side), mac and cheese (it was very cheesy), and Cagney fries. Husband tried out the Bison steak, broccoli, and gratin potatoes. For dessert, chocolate brownie and apple crisp. I really like the Filet mignon; however, Le Bistro may be better.

We were so stuffed, so went for a walk on the promenade.
