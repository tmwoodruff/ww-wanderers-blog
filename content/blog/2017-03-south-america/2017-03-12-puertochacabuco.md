This was also a tender port; we were in port from 10-6. We arrived on time, so tendering was less crazy. However, I think we decided to get in line just as they paused the tender operation - doh. We can get in line to tender, without a ticket, at any time with platinum status. We planned to take the bus from Chacabuco to Aysen and the on to Coyhaique. The trip was the destination; a ride through the Andres Mountains.

After tendering, there was quick x-ray security. We tried the terminal wi-fi when arriving and leaving and did not have any luck getting on. From the terminal, we loaded a big coach outside the port gates to the three white dome tent shopping area. We did not go into the shopping area.

We started looking for the bus to Aysen and started asking people. We caught it walking from the tents, back toward the port gates and toward the water. There is no bus stop sign or any indication, and the bus is really a minivan that people pile in and out of -- it was an interesting experience. It was a $1 US each, and on the way back, we paid in CLP, though I don't remember how much, guessing 500 Pesos. We just handed the driver money when we got off, and we had to ask them to stop when we wanted to stop. We read to get off after passing the red bridge (picture below). We went a little further before we ask them to stop. Another interesting detail is that stop signs in Mexico say "ALTO", but in South America, they say "PARE".

In Aysen, almost everything was closed because it was Sunday. We had read about 2 bus companies that went to Coyhaique; one was open on Sunday. We found the office (from looking at Google maps street view before) of Buses Suray and bought tickets. Also on our bus from Chacabuco was another couple from the cruise ship, so we looked for the office together. I read to be sure to buy return tickets when you buy your to Coyhaique ticket to be sure to get a seat. As far as we can tell, they could not sell the return ticket; though it may have been our lack of Spanish skills. We paid in CLP, which we planned about $6 / person for a round trip.

This was a big coach with assigned seats, though sparsely labeled, so hard to tell which seat was really which. We had to move once to get to the right set. And, sorry I have pictures from a bus...

The pretty scenery

From my research notes, I believe this waterfall is called Virgin Waterfall.

Coyhaique is down there. There are some seat number labels.

We got the last two seats on the bus back. We were not together; I guess we should have waited for the next bus. However, there was not much open on Sunday. My husband was entertained by his seat mates, who may have been returning from a soccer game, drunk. He was in the very back. The lady next to me was very unfriendly. 

Here is the red bridge that you need to get off the minivan from Puerto Chacabuco after passing. We took this picture from the bus stop (there was a bus stop here) where we caught the minivan back to Puerto Chacabuco. The first minivan was very full, so we had to wait for the next. The red bridge is very striking with the mountains and clouds behind it.

After returning to the three dome tents, we had to catch the port shuttle. The port was not far away, but it was secured so everyone had to enter on the shuttle. Though I do not remember if they looked at our ship key cards before letting us on the shuttle. We stopped to take these pictures, and they seemed to be keeping an eye on us to be sure that we did not roam too far. The cruise ship with a beautiful mountain backdrop.

I did not take as many notes from tonight. We went to the Argentinean tango dancers show. I had not sold my husband on seeing them in Buenos Aires, so I had to see this, included. They were very good. After someone tall sat in front of us, we moved to the far side, where I think the opposite side is reserved for suite guests. These were annoying seats with a bar that goes across eye level. We had to lean on it or look under to see. Weird design.

Here is our first towel animal. Before we left home, my husband noted on deck 4 (not across from balconies) that we would not have towel animal priority. I thought he was crazy, but he was right. We only got 3 or 4 towel animals on a 15 night cruise. Our room steward came by once and met my husband. I never met him. He kept us in ice, which is good. I had trouble keeping our third towel -- my hair towel. I left a note one night for an extra, one night my husband went out to get one, and one night I did. When I did, a maintenance guy was walking by, so I asked him if I could have another towel. He was fine with it :). On future cruise, I will need to ask at the beginning.
