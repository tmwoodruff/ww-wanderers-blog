We had the MDR for breakfast where I got my favorite salmon again. After we stopped by the buffet because I wanted an iced bun too for the day's picnic, well, the guy in front of me took the last two on the ship. I asked and went to each bread station...no more :( . Getting off the ship, you walk through the port area and then across a bridge. After crossing, we stopped at a grocery store, Extra, first and found some good snacks that we had for a picnic later. Here is one. I like the Milka Daim bars, so tried Daim SmaBiter. They was very good too. We also got licorice for Travis, and chocolate chip cookies and chocolate chex.

Haugesund City Hall and fountain across from it.

Starting the hike to and around the Djupadalen area. It was challenging to find the trail, getting through town. After finding the trail, there were some muddy, difficult parts of it. There were small kids hiking it too. When we first saw them, they were in a tree in bright, hazard vests. I thought people were trimming the tree at first, then thought kids working in trees, and then just kids playing in a tree. The hazard vests was just for their teachers or adult supervisors to be able to keep up with them. The kids were good at hiking up hill. The old fort (see the dark doorway; I was able to go in) and then a view from the top. Then lots of cut down trees/tree stumps for some reason.

We had a nice picnic by this lake. I like how it was reflecting that covered shelter across the lake. Our shadows on water channel to the lake.

After hiking around the lake, we found a restroom at the end of the hike. There were also students doing their PE run. A waterfall at the end.

The hike back was easier than the hike there. This was a pretty area.

We then walked back to town. We went into one shop in town. She did a great job finding cool offerings for her shop. I got a craft project for my niece's birthday. The Fisherman's statue and the church behind it.

We also had to find the Marilyn Monroe statue. I read that her father was born in Norway, so she has a statue. Then we walked back to the ship. One thing noticed about P&O; is that they never had a welcome back party or any water/lemonade/hot beverage and wet towels available before boarding the ship like other cruise lines do.
