We got up early again to get a parking spot at the Visitor Center and catch the earliest bus possible to start of The Narrows hike. It was dark out; we did get a spot and then needed to decide what clothes to wear/pack for the hike. Travis had a waterproof backpack for gear and snacks. Then we got in line for the bus. Many people got off at the stop for Angel's Landing. We did not do Angel's Landing, but I guess that we should I have. I have since heard that there is a resting place before the cables for those who do not want to go up the cables. I believe now that it also requires winning a lottery permit to hike it...grrr. 

We rode to the end again, Temple of Sinawava stop. This is next to the Riverside Walk Trailhead that takes you to The Narrows hike start. It is a flat, dry hike to start. 

For this hike, we only had my phone camera in a waterproof pouch on a lanyard. 

The hike was not all in water, which surprised me. There was out of the water hiking areas too. This is probably not always true though, depending on the water levels. We went as far as mid-thigh water levels. When we turned around, there were many more hikers coming in than when we were coming in.

We rode the shuttle back and then walked to return the gear. We did not have any rain. I'm ready to go back and hike The Narrows again!
