We got up early and headed southwest toward Zion. We went through a few cool tunnels on the way. It was about a two hour drive. 

Quite a red road. We entered at the east side entry station.

Checkerboard Mesa and Desert Bighorn as promised on the sign.

We continued into the park. I expected Bryce Canyon to be my favorite since it was so different than what I have seen before. However, we got to Zion, and it was so pretty. I don't have a picture, but from the Checkerboard Mesa, the roads descended in S curves and looking down was so pretty.

We found a hike near the east entrance.

A view of a tunnel window from the trail. A tunnel back on the road.

We then got to the challenge part. We arrived at the main road that runs north and south in the park, and we needed to park. We found a place in town, Springdale. This requires some walking to the bus stop and then taking the bus back into the park. 

In the main area of the park, we started with an easy (flat) trail that left from the Visitor Center, where the bus dropped us off. The trail was called Pa'rus Trail and ran parallel to the main park road and Virgin River. This main park road only allows the park operated shuttle buses. 

On the trail, we found the Virgin River, which cuts through the slot canyons for The Narrows hike -- tomorrow. A squirrel at a campground, and more wide open trail. 

This was an unfortunate day to be at the park; it was a free park admission day. Though I guess we see no problem from these trail pictures.

Bridges over the river on the trail.

After walking back to the Visitor Center, we tried out the shuttle to the end of the line. After getting to the end, we did learn that you can't just stay on, but have to get off and wait in line before you can ride back. It had been a longer day, so doh, but I do not remember the long line being too slow. Sporting my covid time required mask on the shuttles.

Back at the Visitor Center, we walked to Zion Outfitter to pick up our gear -- water hiking shoes, neoprene socks, and hiking pole -- for tomorrow's Narrows hike. We were allowed to pick up the rental gear up the evening before, so we could get an early start the next day. They did warn us that there was an x% chance of rain at 3pm the next day. The Narrows can only be hiked when there is not rain. Upriver all rain runoff comes downriver and through the slot canyon to create a very dangerous situation. I also should have explained that The Narrows is a hike through the water of the Virgin River where the river goes through a slot canyon. One can hike it top down or bottom up. We did bottom up since this was easiest from the park shuttle. Once we were happy with our gear fit, we walked back to our parking spot, outside the park, with the gear in hand. Then headed to check into our hotel in St. George. A lot of people stay in Hurricane, which is closer, but this was more affordable. 

I loved the hotel art, made of actual license plates from each state (well, I guess Alaska and Hawaii did not get any love).
