Our last day in Zion, we did a few hikes. Some areas were closed with some damage, but I do not remember the details. Visitor Center and shuttle.

We then went on a hike that went up a hill. I could not find what it was called. It had some good views since it went up. We could see the horse stable from above and found a tarantula and lizard.
