The Hoover Dam is in both Nevada and Arizona. Approaching; Lake Mead is a pretty blue and with the mountains. They were not giving tours while we were there. I though due to covid, but a Ranger said that they were amid switching between vendors so were not offering tours now.

Looking at all that concrete. We learned about the building of the dam and amount of concrete needed in our hotel museum.

The restrooms were fancy, so Travis got some pictures. The building that they were in was also fancy.
