Next, we stopped at the Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. After arriving, we learned that a couple of areas were closed since it was too hot. The coolest looking hike, The Wave, was closed. That was disappointing. Here is the pretty that we got to see. But, one more complaint -- sand is hard to hike through.

We stayed this night in Boulder City, NV in the Boulder Dam Hotel. The hotel was nice and had a Hoover Dam museum included. Hoover Dam was previously named Boulder Dam. The town also had a walking tour where you went around finding art landmarks that we did.
