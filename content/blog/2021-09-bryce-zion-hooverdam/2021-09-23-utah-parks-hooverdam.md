We flew into Las Vegas airport, picked up our rental car, and stopped at Walmart for groceries. No camping this time; we stayed north of Bryce Canyon at Bryce UpTop Lodge, outside of Zion in St. George, and in Boulder City, NV for the return flight. 

It was a four hour drive to Bryce, and it got dark on our drive. We arrived after hours at the hotel, so they just had our key out with our name on it, with others that had not arrived yet. At the end of our stay, we left early, so we just had to drop the key and we never saw the owners. It was a cute motel and very convenient to Bryce Canyon; they also liked macrame here, with it hanging in the main building and in our room. This building had my maiden name, so I had to have a picture with it. Our room with a microwave and fridge.

The next morning at Bryce Canyon we bought our Annual National Park Pass upon entering. I do not remember parking being a big problem. We hiked the first day and focused on stopping at each of the viewpoints on the second day with some hiking later in the day. Entrance sign.

Our first hike was combining three trail for the figure eight that was recommended: Navajo Loop Trail (half of the loop), Peekaboo Loop Trail (half of the loop), and Queen's Garden. We loved the Navajo Loop Trail and did the full loop the next day. I did not like the Peekaboo trail as much; it was a lot of ups and downs. It was also a horse trail so had messes on the trail. 

Navajo trail, going down and look at all those hoodoos. Navajo trail is known for Wall Street with many hoodoos and Thor's hammer.

A bride was trying to get bridal photos on the other side of the tunnel, but also everyone needed to walk here.

This bird very much wanted part of our snack. Then this guy showed up to beg too.

The Peekaboo trail did have pretty views out into the distance.

Viewpoints, starting from the south and working our way both north. The beauty just goes on and on. Natural bridge.

Another couple was doing the viewpoints at the same time, so we kept running into them at each stop. They took a picture of us at the Natural Bridge.

The next day, we hiked to the Fairyland Loop Trail and found the Wall of Windows and Tower Bridge.

Bryce was very pretty with some great hikes. It is different than expected because the hoodoo amphitheater is down below the road level, instead of up like mountains.
