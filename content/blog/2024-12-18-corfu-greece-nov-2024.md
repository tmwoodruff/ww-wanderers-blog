**Exploring Corfu - November 6, 2024**

We had an inside cabin, so a picture of the arrival in Corfu and sunrise from the webcam on TV. The ship looking pretty on the pretty Mediterranean Sea.

We did the 25 minute walk from the port to the main town and passed the new fortress. We never got back to go inside. Motorcycles/mopeds tried to run over us on the walk. You also pass on the way places that sell ferry tickets to Albania. I had not researched this, not knowing that it was an option -- cost, time to get there and back, where to board the ferry and where the ferry lands, what is good to see there, and ferry times, so if you are interested in going to Albania, research and plan beforehand.

In the old town, we walked to the old fortress, except where I got sidetracked by this government building (second picture). We also went around a park with several soccer games in progress.

The old fortress was 3 EURs each; I expected it to be 6 EURs each. So, we got the winter rate here too. A moat by the fort, and main fort entrance building. There was a small museum or display right after entering. The fort had great views at the lower level and from the top. They provided a restroom with one stall per gender. For our first stop, there was no one else waiting, and I used the last of toilet paper -- a couple of squares, so the lady after me had her husband grab some from the men's. They refilled it later for when we stopped before we left. There was a line for both restrooms then with the women's moving faster, surprisingly...one very slow man.

The church also had displays inside, but they were in Greek. There were papers by the door in other languages, but we went through quickly and did not bother getting the English info. The church had plants growing from the roof.

I tried to get a picture of Albania (to find where it was; we could also see the north part of Corfu).

This grass had some crazy stickers that we had to pull off our shoes. Lesson learned, don't follow Travis through the grass. This went down to the sea.

After the fortress, we had gyros, and I had gelato and Travis a beer from a grocery store. Our gyros were from [Pitta pappou](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pitta+pappou/@39.6239678,19.9227144,17z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x135b5eddaa2d0a7f:0x19414e6a72b21d0!2sCorfu!8m2!3d39.6242621!4d19.9216777!16zL20vMGNjM2Q!3m5!1s0x135b5ddce0318959:0x212c18b24dbc93a6!8m2!3d39.6239196!4d19.9227042!16s%2Fg%2F11c1pft7vj!5m1!1e1?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D); they were very good. Here is a picture of mine with the restaurant name in Greek. Travis got lettuce, tomato, and the sauce too; mine was plain. I got gelato from Papagiorgis Patiserie-Gelateria. I tried dark chocolate again; it was very good. The one in Florence was only slightly better.

Travis noticed a money museum; it was free. When we arrived, the gentleman working there gave us an introduction in the first room. The displays were numbered in history chronicle order, so he said to watch the numbers. This covered the history of money in Greece to the Euro today. In the second picture, you see the crazy inflation that they experienced in 1944. They also had government policies of cutting the money in half and just half was valid. It was very interesting.

Tonight we had the complimentary Asian restaurant, Lotus Garden, booked. NCL charged for this at one point, then made it complimentary, but now required reservations and will start charging again on Jan 1, 2025. Travis had the Wakame salad, and I had the pot stickers, which I got fried. The pot stickers were very good. For the main, I gave the Orange Peel Beef another try. I liked it very much on the Spirit and did not care for it on the Jade. I also did not care for it here; the waiter brought me another plate of fried pot stickers at my request -- very sweet! He offered a different main because I should not go hungry. I do not think it is possible to go hungry on a cruise ship. Travis had the Spicy Seafood Udon Soup.

For dessert, we had the Five Spice Cake and Coconut Tapioca Pudding. We went for a walk on the promenade where Travis needed a restroom break. He ended up with the stomach bug. I thought it was food poisoning from his gyro lettuce since I have gotten lettuce food poisoning before, did not have lettuce this day, and since I did not get sick. However, we read on our FB group later that the stomach bug was on our cruise. It was also strange that we did not get washy-washy before reboarding the ship until after this port. On all other cruises, we have hand sanitized before reboarding. He was sick this night and a little iffy for Katakolon, but not too bad. Good night little moon.
