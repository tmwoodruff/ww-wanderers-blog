Our time at Kusadasi was published as 6:30 am to 12:30 pm, so we knew that would be 12:00 pm all board, so not much time. This was the only port that we booked a tour, so with all the covid issues, I paranoidly asked the tour guide if we would make it back on board on time. They reassured me. We booked Ephesus Shuttle for the tour. We debated whether to book Terrace Houses too; extra $10 each. I was not sure if we had enough time (we would have) and if others on the tour would want to go or not. $10 for 4 people does add up, and we were not sure how interesting to the kids it would be. This is a section of Ephesus that is covered and being excavated now. It looked cool from the pictures and videos. 

Upon approach to Kusadasi with the sun rising.

We met our tour guide at the arranged time of 7:30 am. It was just our group; crazy, we had not booked a private tour. The vehicle was a very tricked out SUV, and the closest that I have been in to a limo. The ceiling was lit up with a stain glass like pattern and the first row of back seats faced backwards. 

First stop

Arrived at Ephesus. There are hills around that still need to be excavated where they expect to find more ancient ruins.

Travis found a squat toilet before we left the Ephesus site; it was free. Luckily, I did not find one.

Back in Kusadasi. Our tour was great! We paid while on the drive back and tipped the guide and driver. The one thing that I did not expect was for the tour guide to be related to everyone in Kusadasi and recommending/pushing shopping here and there. We did ask where the ATM was when we arrived in the morning and got cash for Istanbul before leaving. We used USD to get husband some new dinner shoes (his others broke the night before. We were originally going to pay in Euros, but they did not have the right change. They quoted the same price in Euro as USD, though the Euro was stronger.), some Turkish delight candy, and some ice cream before re-boarding the ship. 

Our ship with another, smaller one; I believe it was a Costa ship.

Our tour guide mentioned that birds were the symbol of Kusadasi, and we found the statue that he mentioned.

We had the complimentary Asian restaurant back on the ship for dinner. It was not as good as last time on the NCL Spirit, but I believe Travis and Joel were pleased with it.
