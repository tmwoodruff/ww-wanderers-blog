**A walk around and bell tower performance - November 8, 2024**

We stayed in Messina, walking around, and then watched the noon moving clock tower show at the Messina Cathedral in the Piazza Duomo. I was not too impressed with Messina, but really did want to come to see Sicily. It was very littered. We did not go to Taormina since we do not watch The White Lotus show. We talked to some people that went to Mt. Etna, which sounded cool, though they said that they found a lot of rain on the other side of the mountain. If you have wanted to see Sicily, be sure to well research what city you want to go to and if there is time to go on a cruise stop. 

The town hall, churches, and city pictures from the ship.

There was a U.S. Navy ship in port docked right in front of us, which was interesting.

Walking, we found these cool bird art painted in different colors.

View from the church grounds. I liked these umbrella trees, as someone called them.

I like pictures of other countries' mailboxes, so my mailbox picture. I wanted a Sicilian ball, an arancini, in Sicily. We got one, and I was not impressed. We had a good one in Trieste, Italy.

There were beautiful churches in Messina. This one costs to go in.

I liked this palm tree against this building; it looked very Mediterranean or rather North African to me.

The performing clock/bell tower. It was neat, and the cathedral was very pretty. Look at that detail. There were many vendors in the square while people gathered for the noon show. The lady next to us kept getting approached. I went to her and said that we were going to stand further from them. They must have looked like sure buyers of scarves.

The town hall that I was trying to photograph from the ship is very intricate and pretty too.

For dinner, we had the MDR tonight. Travis had the ravioli with lobster sauce, and I had the Caesar salad. This used to be my favorite but is sort of disappointing now; maybe my taste has changed.

Travis had the Hungarian goulash that he liked and I thought was pretty good too. I had the NY Strip steak from the everyday menu.

For dessert, Travis had the strawberry shortcake, and I had some kind of chocolate cake. The icing was gelatinous that I did not like, so pulled it off.

The moon, the wake, and some Italian city lights. We were surprised at how close Sicily was to mainland Italy.
