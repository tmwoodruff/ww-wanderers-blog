We were finally going on our first Panama Canal cruise. We chose the full transit on a PanaMax ship to experience the old locks. Based on good scheduling for us, we did West to East, though this meant losing time to get from Pacific Time to Eastern Time. Though we lost one less hour because the US ended daylight savings time during our trip. I chose the Island Princess because it had the most promenade, though they did remove the back of the promenade at the aft to add balconies during a dry dock. Sister, Coral Princess, did not suffer this same fate, so I recommend it instead if you have the choice.

The itinerary from the Princess Platter since it changed a couple of times after we booked, for formal night detail, and time change detail. Though they moved the 1-Hr Back at the end to the last night -- get people awake and off the ship quickly. FORGOTTEN IMAGE FROM PRINCESS PLATTER IN LIBRAOFFICE DOC

We stayed one night before the cruise in Long Beach on the historic, hotel-ship Queen Mary. I was very excited! We had a direct flight on American to LAX. We took a Lyft from home to the airport and back since this was a long trip for parking at the airport. Unfortunately, we were traveling to the airport in rush hour both times, so they were expensive. Both our drivers could not speak English, which I think should not be allowed for safety and navigation concerns. On our way home, the under construction highway had changed, my husband was trying to communicate to exit, but he did not understand and missed it, leaving us to go a ways to turn across in stopped rush hour traffic when we could have been home. Then I thought he was going to hit a barrack when my husband was trying to get him to exit after the turn around to not have to turn around again. Aqui! Lyft needs to fix this, or we need to pay more for Uber.

My normal from the plane picture. According to google photos this was taken over Homestead Meadows North, TX. This is very close to El Paso and Mexico. When taking it, I assumed it was New Mexico or Arizona. The flight left on time and was good (uneventful). I started the movie, You're Cordially Invited, and was going to finish it on the way home, but it was gone from the options by our flight home :(. 

At LAX, we caught the shuttle from the airport to the LA public transportation. We bought the transport TAP card (doh, we already had two at home from our 2023 trip) and a trip to Long Beach on the train. No scary fight in our train car like in 2023 thankfully. We had one train change and got off  by Von's for cruise necessities, snack that night, and breakfast. The Queen Mary restaurants looked very pricy. We found a close restaurant for a lunch-dinner. We were first going to do Taco Tuesday at Leo's Mexican Grill. But when we arrived they had closed at 3pm, and it was now 3:15pm. So, we walked to the Dog Haus next and had some fancy sausages. We missed the restroom here because someone came in the side door while we were eating, went into the only restroom, and did not leave. We caught an Uber to Queen Mary. Queen Mary had their Halloween event setup in front, so she dropped us off outside of that. She had to grab a ticket outside the gate, but it said free for a short period of time.

Hello, Queen Mary! She is looking more shiny now; they were still working on her when we saw her in 2023. The hotel entrance was the second covered area in the picture. They checked us off the list and let us enter for check in. We checked in, dropped our stuff in the room, and started exploring the exhibits. They closed at 5:30pm and reopened the next morning at 10am. Though not all displayed closed, some were visible from the normal hallways. At check in, they told us that the rooms did not have an A/C control. We used the provided blanket in the closet, but it was cold. I was disappointed that the rooms did not look more like ship cabins today but looked more like a hotel room. However, the hallways were very stately with wood paneling. It was very roomy. They also noted thin walls to the rooms because when the ship's engines ran that was the white noise, and now we don't have that. They provided earplugs. It was not bad. We got an inside room for the king size bed instead of two twins. I booked the room with the 2024 Black Friday sale. I did not get a picture of the bathroom, but here is the room.
