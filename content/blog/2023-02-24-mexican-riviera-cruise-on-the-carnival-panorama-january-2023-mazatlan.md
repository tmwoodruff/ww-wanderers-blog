**Mazatlan -- January 24, 2023**

For breakfast, I had the Blue Iguana breakfast burrito, which was really in 2 twos flour tacos. They have a jalapeno or wheat tortillas on the menu, but you used to be able to request a flour tortilla, but not now. So, they offered me a flour taco instead. It was good, though not as easy to eat. I also had hot chocolate from the machine. Travis had oatmeal from the buffet...so healthy.

Mazatlan and PV were docked ports; no more tendering. Mazatlan has some cartel vs. government violence at the beginning of the month. Carnival sent a note that are looking for a backup stop if there was any concern the day that we were there. It was safe this day, and there were many officers keeping an eye out. There is a blue line painted to follow into town and back to the ship. After getting off the ship, we stopped at a convenient store close to the port and got some local snacks and candy. We were hiking to the lighthouse with glass bridge overlook. Cool surfboard.

View on the way to the lighthouse trail start.

The lighthouse trail start. I read that it was $1 or 20 pesos for the glass bridge, but it was more -- either $3 for 2 or $3 each. I think that you can hike up for free without doing the glass overlook bridge, but they seem to be selling the bridge to everyone. There was a slow line when we got to the bridge. This also required a hike up -- bad for me. Some going up pictures.

When it is your turn, you go with a group, take off your shoes, and view/take pictures until your group's turn is up.

Then there was another area for view pictures. They also had a small photo exhibit.

Then we walked toward the theater. We walked along the coast. This was cool art.

Arrived at the theater. Someone's site recommended taking a tour (that it was awesome) for 40 pesos or about $2.20. They also wanted more, and it was hard to find someone, find where to go, and how to get in after paying for a ticket. There was no tour. We went in and looked around the theater; they were busy building a set, so we were trying to stay out of the way. There were other displays about Angela Peralta. The theater was pretty.

We got back on the ship in time for late lunch. Travis had buffet salads. I had these items. The Asian flavored short ribs were really good. In front, it was a fried sweet potato and brisket; they were good. The potato wedges were just okay.

A pretty church that I had not noticed earlier caught my eye.

I remembered to captured some menus.

I had the flatbread (it was very good), steak, and melting cake. Travis had the steam mussels, caprese, the corn, chili, quinoa baked tomato, and apple pie; they were all good.

After dinner, we got a drink at Alchemy Bar; Amil was fun and efficient. We enjoyed a conversation with a gentleman at the bar. My favorite is the deal closer.
