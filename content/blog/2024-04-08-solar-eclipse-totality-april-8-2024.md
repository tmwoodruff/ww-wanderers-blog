We are luckily enough to live in a totality band for the April 8, 2024 solar eclipse. We had just over a minute of totality in our location. It did get dark, like dusk, and the crickets started chirping. It was SO AWESOME! I'm ready for the next. I looked up when it will be...not too soon. We loved this one!
