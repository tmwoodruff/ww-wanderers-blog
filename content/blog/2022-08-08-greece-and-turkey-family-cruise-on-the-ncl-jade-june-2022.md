**Mykonos - June 9, 2022**

Mykonos, 8am to 7pm, was our first tender port where all the ships tendered/no docks. A view from the tender of the ship from below.

At the tender port, they had wifi available inside the gates and by the welcome sign, no building, but in the gates. There was an ATM just outside the gate (in front) and paid restrooms to the right. Continue right, along the coast, to the old port area with the main areas to see.

This was our busiest port, with at least 5 ships, in port this day, and the crowds showed it! A view of some of our friends; there was the new RCL Odyssey of the Sea, another RCL, and our sister, the NCL Gem -- the NCL team were very careful to tender us back to the right NCL ship.

A little church; they were family run in Mykonos, with each picking their Saint and celebrating the Saint's day, sometimes competing with other families for the best party when they had the same Saint's day.

This was a fortress along the coast; part was described as a marshmallow, which looked accurate.

The famous windmills; none were sailed or running.

Cool narrow alleyways. We read that the painted streets was lime to help with less sanitary conditions in the earlier days. We saw someone repainting them.

We tried baklava and chocolate cashew cookie from one of the local bakeries. We got the kids a Coke and headed back to the tender port.
