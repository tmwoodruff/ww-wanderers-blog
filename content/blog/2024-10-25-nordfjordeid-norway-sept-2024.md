**Nordfjordeid port became fjord cruising - September 17, 2024**

We arrived and docked in Nordfjordeid. We had an awesome RIB (boat) tour booked to Geirangerfjord, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site and supposed to be one of the prettiest fjords. The tour company sent a reminder email and also changed the time an hour later, so I emailed to confirm that it was later. No explanation at first and still did not say that they changed it, just that the new documentation showed 10am, instead of 9am on my printed tickets. We were most looking forward to this tour. However, it was not to be. The tour was 80% refundable if our ship did not get to port; they auto-refunded it. Though we paid in Norwegian Krone, and I feel like the exchange rate also became less favorable for us for the refund. 

The Captain got us docked, and then with the harbor master determined it was too windy for us to stay docked. We had the submersible moorings like we experienced the previous day in Flam, and they were not rated for that much wind against the full side of the ship. So close, yet so far. After the decision was made, we unmoored and went to do some scenic fjord cruising. This was nice, as we had not gotten to see much or any fjord scenic cruising since we were there when it did not get light as early and got dark earlier. I got some pictures of the town before we left since we did not get to get off to visit it.

The fjord is already looking very pretty.

For our cruising, we went in and out of Nordfjord and Innvikfjorden. We turned around to back track out about 1pm. The cancelled port happened while we were at breakfast in the buffet. After breakfast, we looked out from the aft, behind the buffet and more forward and then went back to our room to get entertainment and put out our make up the room sign. They were not allowed to go into the room without the sign out. We went and hung out in the Crow's Nest for the great forward view of the fjords and read until it was time for trivia.

Not too much more to add to the pretty scenery.
