Santorini, 8 am - 9:30 pm, so a lot time in port. This was also a tender port, and doh, we were about to head down right as they announced open tender. Bad timing; luckily, it was not too busy. On the tender boat -- Joel, Travis, and Owen.

An interesting view from the tender boat.

We took the cable car up instead of walking or the mules. The cable car was 6 Euro for adults and 3 Euro for kids for a one-way ticket; they accepted credit cards. The cruise ship recommended not taking the mules saying that they were not well cared for. We saw them when walking down the switchbacks later but could not tell how well cared for they were or not. I'm not a fan of mules/horses on trails in general -- smelly and leave messes. Cabin car going the other way; they waved for the picture. View of the ship from the cable car.

The inner workings

We found a McDonald's for Travis's coffee restroom break. The receipt had a code for the restroom that reset regularly, but we all went when we could. We also enjoyed an early in the morning McFurry and used the wifi. 

Dominican Monastery and Catholic Cathedral

The views! If you want to stay here, they have places where each unit has their own dip pool.

A camera zoom into Oia. We started the hike but did not go all the way. Owen is not a hiker. What we did has some trails, some walk through towns, and some had to walk on streets -- all with very good views, some with the ocean on both sides.

The comedy -- Santorini is one half of a caldera with other islands around the other side and the ocean filled in the middle.

Starting down the switchbacks where we met the mules on both the top and bottom.

So close, yet so far.

Back to the ship, we knew it was the saddest time of the whole cruise -- packing, as it was our last day.
