I do not have many pictures from the first Sea Day. We went to Sea Day brunch. Over the last several years, it has dropped in service and menu options. It was our weakest service this time too; all of the other service was great! I had the steak and eggs, which was good. I requested Travis have the skillet cake (a thick pancake make in a skillet).

We did several trivias; the first of the day is in the theater with only half the questions (10 instead of 20) with the Cruise Director's show after -- trying to get and keep people in the theater? Another was the Carnival 50 year trivia; we were pretty bad at this. I knew some from watching cruise YouTubers video, but we needed to know better which ship particular features were released on. Then we played Wheely Big trivia with a team and won with a tie breaker of the ravens can't leave the Tower of London or the monarchy will fall.

We had got a Fresh Creations salad on the Serenity (adults only) deck, but there was nowhere to sit with chair hogs, so we went back to Lido. You pick what you want on your salad from lots of choices, and they build it. It was good! But back on the Lido lead to second lunch -- Guy's burger, the Ringer for me and Travis Moroccan chicken and spinach pie.

We also checked out afternoon tea. The speciality or higher quality teas were an extra charge. Only Travis is a tea drinker. Then they had a tray of desserts to go with the tea. There was a large table next to us, and everyone tried everything on the tray, so slow. The best was the macaroon. Afternoon tea was in the MDR but did not require an app reservation; just line up and be seated. This is the first afternoon tea that we have been to on a cruise; it was not very impressive.   

Tonight was elegant night, with the fancy food. Travis had pumpkin soup, spinach pie in phyllo (lunch repeat), and a fruit plate. I had Caesar salad, filet mignon, and the Carnival melting cake.

We saw the comedian Tim and checked out the sky -- found Jupiter, hanging out under the small moon, and Venus. Our new visitor.
