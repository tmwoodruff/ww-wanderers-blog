**Mammoth Hot Springs Terraces - July 20, 2022**

In the afternoon, we went up to Mammoth Hot Springs, 35 miles north from Madison. This was first not reopened after the flood; however, it was reopened by our visit, which was very good news. This was one of my favorite areas on my first visit in 2007. It has changed since then (landscape has evolved), and I did not think as impressive. However, still pretty. Travis remembers us taking a Ranger led tour in Mammoth before. 

Elk hanging out in town. I overheard someone noting that buildings were an ugly green before but now all repainted a cream color. This area was where the military was stationed when they were in charge of protecting and running the park, before the National Park Service took over, so the green.

We did not find parking near the terraces where the hikes start, but we found one in town by the elk. Walking to the terraces, we found some restrooms and then went on to the terraces. Travis, Owen, and Joel at the beginning.

Some cool terraces that look to be starting to form.

Here are some 2022 speculator views; the main one has some waterfalls.

View from 2007; now comparing, they look very similar. There just seemed to be more pools on the top of the terraces before.

On the way back, we stopped and hiked at Artist's Paintpots between Norris and Madison.

We had dinner at the campsite. For dinners, we had frito pie, nachos also with canned chili too and canned cheese, and canned chicken and instant rice. Camping was not as cold the next nights, but still cold. We managed to avoid rain with our cheap tents.
