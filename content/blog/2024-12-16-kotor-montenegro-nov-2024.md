**Kotor - November 5, 2024**

I had not heard good things about Montenegro beforehand. That they did not really like tourists or at least did not like to let them visit the restroom. This was a tender port; our only tender port on the trip. Before today, we received a letter on our door from NCL about where to meet for the priority tender for gold or above status guests whenever you were ready to go on shore. Normally, we just go down to the tender area when we are ready and show our keycard. There were not a large number of us who met at the same time. We were seated in the Aqua MDR and then quickly directed down to the tenders. This was warned as a 25 minute each way tender, so to bring your patience. There was much complaints about this tender process; luckily, we missed most of the pain. After directed down, we waited a long time, so a 20 minute tender would be 25 minutes there and 25 minutes back. They were running ship tenders and local tenders. In the waiting area, there were three lines: a tender ticket line (NCL was on tender ticket 4), the status line, and what seemed to be the ship shore excursion line. Someone who was missing her husband for part of the wait and was tender ticket 11 somehow managed to get in front of the tender ticket 4 line from the shore excursions line. Hearing later, it sounded like one of the NCL tender boats caught fire -- or at least smelled of/leaking diesel, maybe no flames. They made it to shore, but then had to take that one out of rotation. My understanding too was that this was the first time that NCL had to anchor so far from the shore, so they gave us each a $26 port fee credit on our onboard account. We had dinner with the officers the night before, and they alluded to the challenges of today's tendering. Holland America was also in port; they were dock after half the distance closer. Their tenders were angering the local tenders because they would not follow the no wake area speed limit. I also heard that some people had to wait 2 hours for the tender back -- eek. We had a 1 hour in rain and cold wait in Greenland, so yes, annoying. We went back pretty early today, so got back without an issue and to allow time to get back for the restroom. 

Moving past tendering, Kotor is at the of end of a fjord, so like experiencing the Norwegian Fjords -- very pretty. The tender ride was also pretty. Kotor also had a walk the walls, like Dubrovnik. There was a paid and free option. We originally planned the free, but after hiking/stairing up the last two days, I was not up for it for a third day. Also, because the free walk had a challenging window to climb through, that used to have a ladder but no longer did, where people reported human excrement in the area -- the lack of restrooms, I assume, but did not sound pleasant. The goal of both ways was to get to the Kotor Fortress on the top of the hill. 

Upon arriving, we took a goodbye from Montenegro picture instead of the welcome to Montenegro picture. This side was less crowded; later it made sense why.

I believe that the walk went up that mountain; we could see hikers. I wondered what time they got started, especially since tendering took some time. We found some free walls to walk on that stayed closer to town, which are called Kotor City Walls. There was a nice old town area, enter through Sea Gate, with a view of the church in the hills and a model of the town and mountain.

We next went up on the walls for a view down.

We arrived at the Scurda river beside the old town walls; there were a ton of seagulls chillin in the water.

This led to two churches; one active and one in ruins and not used now but still very pretty with nature growing on and in it.

Next, we found a cat park. I loved the little baby kittens. There was a sign saying that a lady took care of them. So, there were houses set up for them, and she put out food. Also, awesome, like nothing I have seen before, there was a plastic water bottle recycling, and if you recycled two bottles, you were dispensed cat food to feed the cats. Unfortunately, we did not have two water bottles that we could give up with us. This was in a public square that also had a water fountain (below).

We stopped by a grocery store and then reentered the old town to see more. In a guidebook, there was a war museum, from the Yugoslavia breakup wars, mentioned that I wanted to go to. However, it looked no longer in existence; we could only find the Maritime Museum. I should have planned this better because we were also in Croatia. The old town water fountain, Old Fountain Karampana.

Tonight we had the Italian restaurant specialty dining with our status meal credit. It was dark, so dark pictures.

Travis had Caprese salad, and I had calami. It came with a whole baby squid or octopus; this one was the best part.

For a main, I had the salmon. I was disappointed in it though; it was not very good. I had a very good one in the MDR on P&O;, so I was hopeful for this one. Travis had the shrimp skewer. Then I had the cannoli, for a second night in a row, that came with chocolate, pistachio, and tutti fruity. Travis had the classic -- tiramisu. Pizza could be ordered instead of an entree, not also, like at one point.
