**Benjamin Franklin Bridge, Fed, Mint - Sept 25, 2022**

Today we walked across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge to New Jersey and found Camden and saw their Rudkins University location. It was a challenge to find the entrance to the pedestrian walkway. From Google maps, we could only tell that it was near the Benjamin Franklin park, which walked through another day. It had a fountain, putt-putt, and a merry-go-round. Trying our best to follow our GPS location and map, we finally found a sign saying where to go. The first entrance was closed, but I saw an under the highway walkway (first thought it may be the entrance to the bridge), which did go to the other side, which was side.

After the walk back, we wanted to find lunch on South Street known for its restaurants. Well, it either had a rough covid time or only open in the evening; from what I can tell, a combination. We did not find anything for lunch. Getting back to the main area, we found Crown Chicken. My chicken and fries were good. I was excited to get a meal and soda (had not had any caffeine on the trip yet), but should have noticed they only had cans of Pepsi or Mountain Dew, no Pepsi Max or diet. Travis got a gyro that was really bad; he said it was drenched in salad dressing. Gyros are supposed to have a cucumber yogurt sauce. We ate our leftovers in the evening; he tried to remove the salad dressing to make it edible. This place had quite a variety of food types -- fried chicken and gyros, just with what we got.

I had heard of this but did not know the history, so I took a picture.

We went back to the hotel for a little rest. Then went back to the Independence Hall area to visit the Federal Reserve's Money in Motion exhibit and then the Mint. This was is an old insurance building; very interesting looking. Shipping had the first insurance offered since it was risky with weather and pirates. The Money in Motion exhibit was very good, offered free educational brochures that we brought some home to our kids (they were excited, not) and a free bag of shredded money worth $100. The Mint was also very cool to see the process of designing and then watching the minting process live.

We packed when back at the hotel, and left early the next morning to returned to Suburban Station to catch the train to the airport.
