**March 16, 2022**

We flew into Las Vegas and rented a car with a work discount at Avis. The bus to the rental car lot had a long line with no buses coming, but finally multiple came to shorten the line. Avis in Vegas was a lot less pleasant experience than our Avis rental in Bozeman, MT (where they were awesome!) -- they did not have the car size that we reserved, so pushed many upsells, allowed only one driver, and then more upsell pushed. They found us a size bigger (with California gas prices, we were not excited about too big) and noted to wait in the garage where they would bring it by the Avis #1 club area (whatever they call their club) while they prepared it. We knew the color, make, model, and license plate, but no one drove a car to this area. I saw a gray car drive into another area so went to check the plate. It was the right car, so went back to get Travis. Loaded our luggage and to show our id and contract on the way out. We stopped in Vegas for grocery shopping and then off to Beatty, NV. We stayed at [Atomic Inn](https://atomicinnbeatty.com/); it was interesting and cutely decorated with an alien theme. The bed was a little firm and only had 3 pillows when we like 2 each. I used the decorative pillow with my jacket around it as a huggy pillow. The TV had DirectTV; we had a microwave and refrigerator, which was good for food prep from our grocery shopping. Beatty is a small town, so not many food choices. The bathroom fan was too loud (metal scrapping noises) to use; the towels did not absorb water -- have never experienced that before. We had an assigned parking spot, which worked well; it took me a little bit to figure out the key and two locks. 

After checking in and dropping off our luggage and groceries, we went for a quick visit of Rhyolite Ghost town before it got dark. There was an awesome full moon!

This statue was as one was heading into Beatty. It was a neat metal cut out.

I always have to stop for the National Park entrance sign. We visited before the August 2022 floods; it looked crazy with mud trapping cars. That would be no fun with a rental car. We first headed to Badwater Basin. Driving in, Travis noted no gas needed, all downhill. We could also see the salt basin from a distance and above.

Badwater Basin - 282 feet below sea level.

This is also where the Sea Level sign was up in the hill behind the parking lot. 

Devil's Golf Course -- we found one of his golf balls. Someone was there hitting them in and getting pictures. I'm not sure if that was allowed but a cute idea. This park is different in that visitors are allowed to explore anywhere, off trails. Other parks, they want visitors to stay on the trails to protect the park.

Artists Drive was a one way side road with hikes at Artists Palette.

At Furnace Creek Visitor Center area, in addition to a general store with pricey ice cream, was a good display with an informational paper to go around to learn about the old borax mining equipment.

Furnace Creek also had the most expensive gas.

In afternoon, it was cloudy and kept the temperature comfortable. We went to visit the Pupfish on the Salt Creek Interpretive Trail north on 190 from Furnace Creek.

**March 18, 2022**

In the morning, we started at Zabriskie Point Badlands and then hiked to Gower Gulch and then hiked to Golden Canyon for the Ranger lead tour. Zabriskie Point:

This Stovepipe Wells Village Visitor Center. This was the affordable side of the park. We had an affordable ice cream and the gas was cheaper than by Furnace Creek.

Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes

Dante's view and Dante's Ridge hike. We went left first; it was a great view out onto a hill that overlooked below but was very windy. Then we started the long hike right, not planning to hike the full trail. You could see the trail ahead over the tops of the hills. This was my favorite hike.

The semi-circle deposits below are called alluvial fans.
