**Rhodes - June 10, 2022**

Rhodes, 7am to 6pm, was a great medieval city. It is very close to Turkey. Fortress and Costa ship from the ship. Fortress walls with Travis and Owen.

We enjoy walking on the promenade deck in the evening to burn off some of those dinner calories. A great sunset from the aft MDR and the moon from deck.
