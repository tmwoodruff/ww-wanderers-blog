Embarkation day is the most exciting! But to go back in time first. We checked in online when it opened 30 days before. I put Travis first on the reservation, so only he could pick the check-in time. When we booked, we were assigned a 10am checked, but it defaulted to 10:30 am when we did the online check-in. Only he was able to change it back to 10am. I heard it got busier at 10:30 am, but 30 minutes probably did not make that much difference and people do not follow their assigned time well, I suspect. 

The challenge was taking our pictures online for the cruise, used when getting on and off. Mine worked pretty quickly, but took the picture while I was still trying to move where it wanted me to. So, it was blurring with movement with no retake option. Travis was asking how the MSC camera looked when it worked for me because his was not working (the camera was a popup window on the MSC check-in website that told you to move your head up or down or get closer or further that you were trying to read whilst smiling for a picture) and what got it to finally work. Joel's on my computer gave some trouble but then took. Owen's was not taking for anything. It did take quickly on my phone, but then wanted to take a picture of his passport page too, which then it did not like the passport picture. So, back to the computer. He tried my computer and Travis's. He pulled his hair back, different backgrounds, different lighting, etc., etc. He was talking to it, "I'm a real boy, take my picture." Finally, it worked, and we showed completed check in on the computer. I was able to get the boarding docs on the computer. I was afraid to touch anything else in the app on the check-in and lose Owen's picture. Later, the app showed checked in and the website showed incomplete check-in, and Travis and I both got an email to complete the check-in. Since I had the boarding passes and luggage tags, I went with we were good and ignored the incomplete messages. 

We had breakfast at our hotel and headed to the subway, another station, just a little further away, to get to a subway line that we needed using Google maps directions. In Brooklyn, from the subway, we stopped at Walgreens/Duane Reade for lotion since we could only bring 3.4 oz on the plane (though I should have thought to bring multiple little containers since the kids had extra liquid space). We looked at a CVS in the Bronx, but it was mostly empty -- I have never seen anything like it before, so this was take two for the lotion. Then we caught bus B61 (B for Brooklyn, I guessed) to the cruise terminal (Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, 210 Clinton Wharf, Brooklyn, NY 11231). 

Upon arrival, we found (through lots of traffic and walkers) the luggage drop off, completed that, then showed our boarding passes and passports to entry the security line. We were yelled out by a "friendly" New Yorker, port worker for not having the passports open and pushed behind another family, so open all your passports to the picture page and stack them together. We got through security, and I managed to lose the fam. Noticed and went back which involved walking backwards in the winding line. This line was for check-in. They scanned our boarding passes and confirmed our passports. I asked for a new picture since mine was blurry. Owen was definitely not getting a new one; we worked too hard on the one that he had. They happily took a new one for me, but did not required it like NCL, after NCL forces you to take one at online check-in too, but before picking a boarding time. We were given boarding number 28 and directed to a seating area. They had restrooms and a cafe to buy coffee and snacks in the back of the terminal. The numbers were being called quickly, and they kept announcing to only come up when your number was called and turned away those coming too early.

They announced pushing that you go up to your cabin to get your key cards right after boarding. Three of our four suitcases were already at our door. A little strange since they were all together, but the last one did arrived later. I was asking the family if we need to take them in or just take the key now. The room steward came out, and I tried to ask him but was not well understood. We left them out, and they would have been in his way in the small cabins. Carnival gives you the keycards at the cabin but only when cabins are ready. NCL gives them at check-in in the terminal. Cabins ETA was 1:30 pm. We were on very early; the earliest that I had ever been on. I believe a little before 11am. Our sail away was 3pm. 

We had lunch at the buffet; the MDR was not open and no other included restaurants. While there, I booked our shows for the week. I booked all nights, except for the first night and the second magic show. We do not normally attend that many shows, but we could cancel them and others get in if we decided against one later. You reserve space but not a specific seat. You have to arrive 5 minutes before the show; at 5 minutes before, they start letting in people without reservations. They have two lines, which worked well. The first night, they just scanned one keycard and checked us all in. The second night, they thought I was crazy not having my keycard ready. From then on, they scanned everyone's keycard. 

With lunch eaten and shows booked, we had to start focusing on the muster drill. They announced it, and we watched the safety video on TV...twice since we started too early. It gave us the code, and I called the number with it. It said "request recorded". Then the next morning we got a "you have not done your safety video" letter on the day. So, I called again and put in the code again. I had written it down, so still had it handy. I guess it worked the second day because we did not hear anymore on it. I wish there was some better confirmation that it is complete than just "request recorded" since that did not work the first time. After the safety video the first day, they announced to go to your muster station, which we did. Before the muster started, Owen noticed that the could not find his keycard (geez, already), so we searched the whole cabin and outside the door, thinking he pulled it out to open the door, while unpacking with no luck. We were afraid that he would need it to complete the muster. At the muster station, I asked, and crew member said that they can check us all into muster that "this is important" and to go to guest services for another after. So, we did that. It was scan your keycard and walk through the theater; ours was A in the theater. Then we got in the long line, that got longer, for guest services. It was officially closed for services closed during the 1 hour muster drill; however, they had one gentleman taking inquires. When we were close to the front, another person came further back in the line to see if she could help. She couldn't and said to wait until they reopened. When we got to the gentleman, he said that guest services was opening but stay with him because he already requested the card reprint from his ipad. We also asked about Owen's chat feature. I found before we left home that they had a free chat feature, so that we would not lose anyone on the ship. This was awesome, and I had the kids get the MSC for Me app too. It was working for all of us but Owen. So, we asked while at guess services. It only works for adults; Joel's 18 so had no issue. That answered that. It did let you connect to anyone on the ship. Though they could have allowed it among minors with just people on their booking or in their cabin. Owen still used the app to see the menus. While waiting for guest services, they were calling to go to muster by decks. Strange, it was not noted by deck at the beginning. People complain about MSC's muster, about everyone going down at once. Maybe announcing later by decks they can say that they do that. The stairs were busy, but checking in was quick. 

Sail away...and we are off. Views from our front facing window (deep window) of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. It looked like we were going to hit a container ship (below) -- constant bearing, constant speed. The official nautical term looks like Constant bearing, decreasing range (CBDR). But, not an issue. There is also the Anthem of the Seas heading out in front of us.

Two decks of traffic. The guys went to the gym while I finished unpacking and took these pictures. I also did a quick tour of decks 6 and 7. They said that they saw the bridge from the gym. The gym had a much better view than our last ship, the NCL Star. It looked out to the walking trail and could see to the pool deck, but you could also see water off both sides. It was on deck 16. 

Close passage under the bridge.

We dressed for dinner. Your assigned dining room, time, and table number is on your keycard. The first night they were taking people to their table. We passed a close number, but our escort kept going. When he was having trouble finding it, I noted that I saw a close number back in a section over there. We all went back, looked, and found it. Our waiters were Ramon and Carlos. They were awesome. Ramon said something that made me ask if we don't wait to be seated on the future nights and just come and sit down here. Fixed time dining, at the same table was brand new for us. He confirmed that we just sit down. We were not sharing with any other families and had a rectangular table for 4. We had line of site to windows, but were not very close to a window. Behind Owen and me, there is a TV showing their specialty dining food preparation. They were scattered about. TVs in the main dining room seemed odd; not making for a very formal experience.

My chicken croquettes -- they were very good; followed by Travis's bay scallop ceviche. I did not get pictures of all. Joel had the fire roasted creamy tomato soup saying that there was not much fire and that it was very creamy. Owen had the Caesar salad. For mains, we had: me - NY strip steak (ok), Travis - Chef's Indian vegetarian (fine; not spicy and would have been better with more spice), and the kids - lasagna.

I did get dessert pictures. Both kids got the warm apple crumble and enjoyed it very much. Travis had the Coconut pistachio dacquoise, and I had Grandma's chocolate cake that Ramon asked/recommended a la mode (a good choice). Everyone liked their dessert.

After dinner, we checked out the chocolate store. They were starting an owl; he was completed and displayed at the end of the cruise. There were several other cool chocolate statues to see.
