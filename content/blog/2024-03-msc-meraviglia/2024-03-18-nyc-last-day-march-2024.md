We walked across the Queensboro Bridge (like in the show King of Queens theme song) and over Roosevelt Island. We saw the Roosevelt Island tram going across.

We arrived at the UN. Joel did the Model UN club in high school. They let people in as tours but did not have any walk up tickets available this day. I should have planned better but did not even know that normal people could go in. The first pictures are the garden, which we could not go into either. It seems like they could let people walk around the garden without a security concern.

We met one of my previous co-workers for lunch at the NYC office and visited the red balloon animal dog. We planned to go to a Mexican place, but after walking there, it was not open. So, we went to the McSorley's Old Ale House, established in 1854. Travis was the only one allowed a beer (since he was not working, and I don't like beer); they had two types: light or dark. A beer order was actually two beers. Kids were allowed in until 6pm. They were very friendly and fun, and the food was good.

We stopped at Whole Foods for some ice cream and got a multiple pack of miniature Dove ice cream bars. We took them to Washington Square Park and enjoyed. I was sad that the fountain was drained when we were there since it is a nice fountain and nice in the middle of the park. It was entertaining skateboarders instead.

Then we walked to Chinatown where Travis and the kids founds some interesting candy and snacks.

The next morning, one more stop at Trader Joes in Queens for plane snacks and Dunkin Donuts for breakfast. Then we headed toward the World Trade Center station to catch the PATH to NJ Penn Station. There we caught the bus; it seemed well signed but still confusing. We had to pick a bus when buying the tickets, 62, but 67 came first, and the driver noted it was the same.

We had an uneventful flight (the best kind) and arrived home on time. We got two seats together, and I got a window to look out. The kids were in middle seats further back. That's a wrap on Joel's graduation cruise and trip to NYC.
