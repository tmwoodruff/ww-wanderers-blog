**Icebergs and more sea days -- July 19-21, 2023**

In the morning, we learned that the Greenland current had blocked the opening to the fjord with icebergs and that we were blocked in. Though the fog was improved. So, I got more icebergs, but more than I needed. So, plan C was waiting for a container ship coming by about noon and following it out of the ice field that we were now in, as well as, no more Greenland stops and heading back to Iceland for an additional day in Reykjavik. The Captain said that they looked at ice maps for the last 10 years and have never seen this much ice in late July. 

More iceberg pictures.

Our container ship arrived. It is a small one; I guess that they don't need to move too much cargo in the Artic. Then the sailboat that also got stuck in the ice field and was following us out. Until they felt that they were in the clear and that we were going to slowly. I thought I got a picture of it darting around and very close to our aft, from the aft, but I do not find it now. So, attached is the best that I found, but I think this is from the side and earlier -- still a lot of ice around.

Lunch at O'Sheehan's; my favorite, but not Travis's. He found something that he really liked: Lechon Asado; he said that the pork was really good. We shared the spinach and artichoke dip. I had fish and chips.

Here we go; out of the ice field. Greenland is run by Denmark -- little Denmark running big Greenland where Denmark has a much larger population. So, our Captain and bridge team had the assistance of a couple of Danish pilots onboard helping on the bridge to navigate the ice. They were using the ship's side thrusters to push the ice away. We could see them at the edge of the bridge watching and ordering which thruster to turn on when. It looks true that there is more to the iceberg under the water. Our Captain did not want to be another to hit a growler iceberg (which I learned was like the one right below) like happened on the NCL Sun earlier this year in Alaska, also in the fog.

Thrust away; they did seem to be drawn to the cruise ship.

I have never seen so many crew in the crew area on the bow at one time, so I took a picture of the bow cam.

After passing out the ice field, we continued trivia and other cruise director staff activities and collecting signatures on our cruise director staff cards for a prize at the end. We got a deck of cards and something else, bad I cannot remember now. They were generous and with the prizes. Tip that I have not tried -- I heard that you can get free used deck of cards from Customer Service that the Casino used but cannot use for very long based on regulation game rules (I don't know these official rules or the life of a deck of casino cards). 

Travis did a martini tasting; the grasshopper (green one) was really good! It is $20 for six small martinis; a really good deal. Each participant got a chance to bartend too and have their made drink in the full size. It is also a fun social activity. I got another grasshopper later in the cruise since it was so good.

I also got a Bushwhacker; it was pretty but too coconut-y tasting. I have had them before with no issue. Maybe just not made well; I should have went for the Mudslide instead.

All that I have from dinner pictures was my slider app, which was good.

Now I have several days of dinner only pictures. 

I had the grilled iceberg wedge salad; I just had to see what a grilled iceberg was all about. I also had beef brisket; they were both good. Travis had the tortellini soup. He asked if it had clear broth, but it came creamy anyway. He was trying for healthier. He had the grilled vegetables. For dessert, I had the milk chocolate mousse, and Travis had mojito fruits. We had an awesome waiter in the MDR, Joycelene; she was so fun. Excitingly, we got her the next day too in a slightly different location.

On Friday, we had our platinum around the world wine tasting tour; it was in the Italian restaurant with tables moved. We both went, but I'm not a big wine drinker so did not have any. There was a red and white from each of the featured countries. The countries were Argentina and Chile, France, Italy, and the USA. I expected some snacks with each, like cheese, but they just had some hard breadsticks. I ate some.

For lunch in the buffet, I found a pork cordon bleu, never seen it with pork instead of chicken before, it was good. Travis found a fish curry that he liked. 

For dinner, I got the cheese ravioli with a lobster sauce. It too had must of a fishy taste for not being a proper fish, just like the crab wontons did. I guess they are adding fish favor to improve them?; I was not a fan. I also had teriyaki beef, which was just okay. Travis had beef broth soup and Cajun style shrimp.

The last night, we ate at the Brazilian restaurant for my birthday, but we got a picture of the MDR menu at the Aqua. We never ate in the Aqua; we like the more formal and not such close tables in the aft MDR. Also, it opens earlier.

With the missed ports, here was our final itinerary, onboard credit given. We also got a future cruise credit as a percentage. I'm not sure how that will work, but I have picked a cruise to find out. Though NCL kept our port fees. I heard that you have to request them back at guest services. They shot me down saying that if corporate decided to return them that everyone would receive them. I guess corporate decided it is better for the bottom line to keep them. I guess they did have to pay at Dj to try to tender. I don't know if they had to pay for the Dutch pilots. We did not get close to Paamiut or Nuuk, which saved fuel cost. 

After the many sea days, I felt really bad for the crew, who were getting no break from us. Also, as I mentioned earlier, there was limited place to sit and always busy in the buffet, so I was eager to get off on some land too. 

With our included platinum laundry, we sent two bags on two days. NCL went to only one room service per day, and the laundry said that the room steward had to take by noon to be returned the next day. Though that did not happen, he got the laundry back both times very quickly.
