**Arriving in Long Beach - January 20, 2023**

This was a very good deal cruise that we found and booked in the cheapest room, bottom deck, inside room -- deck 1, room 1442. We had never been on a Mexican Riviera cruise, and it was on the list.

Friday, January 20th, we saw the kids off to school, finished the pre-trip chores and packing, and drove to the airport at 8:30 am for a 10:45 am flight. We were on Spirit direct from DFW to LAX. We had express north parking and one checked bag with Spirit pre-booked. I swore that Spirit's check bag was previously 50 lb, but eek!, they have now reduced it to 40 lbs. Ours weighted 39.5 lb before leaving, so that was a good buffer. However, with the new 40 lb limit, it was tight...could not add anything from the trip! Geez, we may not be able to take Spirit to a cruise anymore. We were leaving from terminal E, where the luggage check-in is. Sometimes they leave from terminal D, so you have to go to E to check the bag. The person at the self-bag was busy playing on her cell phone but it later worked. At LAX, the lady was helpful getting the machine to work. After printing the check tag at the first machine, you go to check the bag at the next machine, which reads your boarding pass, scans your id, takes your picture, weighs the luggage, and then takes the luggage away on a conveyor belt. 

Our flight to LAX was smooth, except one passenger that kept getting up, including during the safety announcement where he asked the flight attendant if he could get around to go to the restroom. This makes them stop the safety announcement until everyone is seated again. We also recognized this flight attendant from another flight. After getting our checked luggage, caught the bus from LAX to the main Metro station; this leg of the trip is free. It is called the Green line and comes through the airport. From the main station, you can buy a $1.75, 2 hour, with transfers + $2 for the Tap card, so $3.75 each to Long Beach. Next, the Green line to Willowbrook/Rosa park, toward Norfolk and transfer to the Blue line to Long Beach. Luck for the transfer, as a fight had broken out in our train car. Eek! I looked for an officer when we got off, but someone in a orange vest looked more like a maintenance worker and not law enforcement officer, and someone not to send into a fight situation. We got off at 1st Street for our hotel. Since it was still too early for check in, we stopped for a combination lunch/dinner at Wa Wa Chinese. For $11+tax, we got a big serving of orange chicken, kung pao, fried rice, and noodles, which was plenty to share. Fifty cent fee for using a credit card that we did not see until after. Then, we went to Vons grocery store for soda to take on board, breakfast for the next day, and a few snacks. Travis signed up for the Vons reward card to get the sales before we left home. They had a security officer. We walked in with our big luggage (had not been to the hotel yet), shopped, did the person check out since Travis picked a beer and no alcohol in self-check out, and then packed the groceries in our carry on bags (no bags in California -- have to bring your own or buy them). Then you have to walk by many other groceries to get out. Telling Travis to hold the receipt, but it look shady, but the officer did not give us any trouble. 

Then on to the hotel. Our hotel was the Vagabond hotel. It was a good location and reasonably priced. It was strange because it required a $100 cash deposit for any damages. We knew about this when booking it, but we had never heard of anything like this before. Why cash and not a credit card? They gave you a paper with instructions on getting the inspection and cash back. They stressed not to lose it -- do a lot of people lose it? In the morning for check out, we called the front desk to request the inspection (after fixing the phone -- the headset was unplugged and hard to get it to click into place); they said they would send housekeeping to do the inspection. I was not sure if we should wait for them or not; Travis thought not. I guess not because we went to check out, and they gave us the cash back in a paperclip. Maybe it was our original cash. After arriving, I took pictures of room flaws, kept finding more, and wondered why this deposit as the room was not emaulate by any means. 

After getting settled, we went out to explore Long Beach. We walked to the beach, around the lagoon (which had Swan paddle boats for rent for $12/person for an hour), to the birdcage (a spinal stair alternating with ramps up for views and bridge over the lagoon), through the marina and restaurant and shopping area, and up to the lighthouse (they had changing colored lights shining on the lighthouse and a display and pictures of history in Long Beach). We caught a glance of a cruise ship; it was not ours. It was the Carnival Radiance. The cruise terminal is only used by Carnival; it is a dome shaped terminal -- it was cool looking. It looked like other cruise lines used a terminal further west in San Pedro. The cruise ship through the very tall, skinny palm trees.

Then we found Queen Mary! The City of Long Beach owns and has been fixing her up. Before covid, she served as a hotel, restaurant, and tours. With the restoration and covid, they have been closed. I kept watching for the tours to open. Then during the holidays apparently they did, and I got behind checking with the holidays. They tours showed full. Maybe they were filled very quickly, but I was super annoyed and disappointed!

The sailboat was nice with the sun setting. Queen Mary with the terminal dome, Radiance, Travis, and port cranes.

Terrace Plaza foundations. They were choreographed and danced to Jump by Van Halen, which was awesome.

Long Beach was a nice walking tour. We returned to the hotel for our cruise tomorrow!
