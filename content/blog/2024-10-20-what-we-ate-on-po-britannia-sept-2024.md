Menus are compliments of our waiter and assistant waiter on the last night (so I do not have the last night's). We had set dining at 6:30 pm, first seating with a table, next to a window, for 8. 

**September 13, 2024**

Menu:

What we ate:

Dutch-Style Golden Fried Chicken Croquette with Onion Ring - GOOD

[<img width="320" src="images/IMG_8741.webp"/>]({% image "content/blog/images/IMG_8741.webp" %})

  


Ham and Puy Lentil Soup 

  


[<img width="320" src="images/IMG_8742.webp"/>]({% image "content/blog/images/IMG_8742.webp" %})

  


Sea Bream Fillet

  


[<img width="320" src="images/IMG_8743.webp"/>]({% image "content/blog/images/IMG_8743.webp" %})

  


Grilled Prime 5 oz Beef Sirloin - OK - the Bearnaise Sauce was good on the steak

  


[<img width="320" src="images/IMG_8744.webp"/>]({% image "content/blog/images/IMG_8744.webp" %})

  


Steamed Sticky Toffee Pudding

  


[<img width="320" src="images/IMG_8745.webp"/>]({% image "content/blog/images/IMG_8745.webp" %})

  


Mint Choco Chip - VERY GOOD - the chocolate chips were not like chips, but were very soft making it easy to eat. The British desserts had too much fruit included for my taste. Only three desserts + nightly ice cream selection + nightly cheese plate is not very many dessert options. The MDR was also the only place to get included ice cream; there was no free soft serve or regular ice cream on the Lido deck. There was paid ice cream on the Lido deck; I do not feel like any Lido deck is fancy enough for paid ice cream.
