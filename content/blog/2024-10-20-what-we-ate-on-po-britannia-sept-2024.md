Menus are compliments of our waiter and assistant waiter on the last night (so I do not have the last night's). We had set dining at 6:30 pm, first seating with a table, next to a window, for 8.

What we ate:

Dutch-Style Golden Fried Chicken Croquette with Onion Ring - GOOD

{% image "images/IMG_8745.webp" %}

  


Mint Choco Chip - VERY GOOD - the chocolate chips were not like chips, but were very soft making it easy to eat. The British desserts had too much fruit included for my taste. Only three desserts + nightly ice cream selection + nightly cheese plate is not very many dessert options. The MDR was also the only place to get included ice cream; there was no free soft serve or regular ice cream on the Lido deck. There was paid ice cream on the Lido deck; I do not feel like any Lido deck is fancy enough for paid ice cream.
