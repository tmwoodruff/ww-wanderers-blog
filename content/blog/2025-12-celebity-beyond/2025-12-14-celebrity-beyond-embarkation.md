I had an Edge class ship on my wishlist. I found the Celebrity Beyond on Dec 14th for a reasonable price (a lot more affordable than the Ascent for some reason). It was also near Christmas to get to see the Christmas decorations. We had a flight the day before, but it was later, so I'm not sure that it afforded us much protection from missing the cruise. We did get to Miami and home, even during the busy Christmas season on the 22nd, with no issues. 

Our plane had a long push back since we were in a "U" terminal area and could only be reversed -- weird. After we were pushed out of the terminal area, we, from our last row seats, started smelling fuel, which brought up concerns about our plane. Then I saw some firetrucks heading our way and then saw this. I have never seen anything like that before. Sunset from the flight.

We stayed at the La Quinta northwest of the airport. We stopped outside of security at the MIA airport and got each got an empanada. They had a shuttle available until 9:30 pm. When we found it, we saw it fill with a family who was trying to put a child in the front in the lap of the Dad. The driver said no. They had more luggage and people that did not make it on. I called the hotel, but we decided not to wait for it and Ubered. For our Ubers on the trip, I have to say that I'm tried of the price going up one or more times before we book it and after we get to a good spot to wait for an Uber. Is this a known tactic of theirs that I should know about and not pre-price a ride?

The La Quinta was fine; it was funny because the room was almost identical to one that we stayed in in College Station. I did discovery that they/Wyndham have a very nice scent for their body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and soap. It was brand Old Town Woodbury&Co Apothecary; it reminded me of MSC's scent that I loved. We had the hotel breakfast. It was advertised as grab and go, but they had more and tables to sit and eat. It was fairly crowded. 

We caught a bus and then a train to Publix to get some soda to take on board. The Publix only had buy one, get one free. We did not have enough time to drink two cases or wanted to carry two cases. So, we went across the street to Target to look there. We found a case of Pepsi Max. 

We then walked to catch the Corral Way trolley route to the Port of Miami. Again, there was a large group with tons of luggage in front of us. He said they were full and did not let anyone on. We decided to walk. Celebrity had moved us from terminal E to terminal C, so this was a further walk. It was hot and up a hill until on top of the bridge. We were still faster than the cars for most of the walk. Traffic was moving very slowly. Miami is too crowded, with only one road in. There were seven ships in port -- Carvinal Celebration and Horizon, Virgin Voyages, Symphony of the Seas and another RCL, and NCL Aqua. It was cool to see NCL's newest ship when we sailed away ahead of it.  

During check-in, the earliest available arrival time and that we picked was 12:30-1pm. After our long walk, we arrived right on time, a couple of minutes after 12:30pm. Embarkation was quick -- we went through security first. We carried our on own luggage on since it was documented that we would be allowed to immediately put in room. We were also close to the normal allowed in your room time. So, we had our roll-aboard bags through security too but did not spend the time to drop them off with the porters. The sodas just went through the X-ray machine, no issues, no ripping the box apart like Carnival does. 

Next, we checked in with boarding pass and passport. This was quick, but annoying (to me) because they retook our pictures -- we both did pictures in the app in the 3 weeks before check in. I redid mine a couple of times with the right hair and makeup on, but they did not use it. So instead, I had a "lovely" sweaty, after walking over the bridge picture, with a ponytail and sweated off makeup -- boo! After check, we were allowed to walk onboard immediately with one more scan of our boarding pass. 

Onboard, our muster station was right there -- the steakhouse -- so, we completed that. We had watched the safety video on the train with train wi-fi.

Then, we went to restaurant to try to change from late dining to early dining, but learned that we had anytime, which is good, but not expected since I only saw early full and no anytime option. They advised not eating between 6-7pm since we are early eaters this is fine and never had a wait. There was later confusion about anytime dining where a hostess (I believe was the same hostess) came back with a tablet asking about our reservation and disappointed that we did not have on. Since the app had the reservation button grayed out, I asked at another restaurant during the day, the next day, and he said that it was crazy that she expected us to have a reservation for anytime dining. I should back up an explain that this ship had four MDR rooms with a set of the same common dishes and a set of exclusive to that restaurant dishes. The four were Cosmopolitan (American), Tuscan (Italian), Normandy (French), and Cyrus (Mediterranean). Cyrus and Normandy were our favorites. Anytime dining let us pick from any of the four, and we tried all. You could supposedly get an exclusive from another restaurant to which ever you were in since they shared the same galley.   

This was at Cyrus, a rock "painting".

Finally, we went to our room to drop off the luggage, and it was already ready. The safety video was on, so we watched that again. Then we headed up to the buffet with two of our sodas. We finished up texting with our family before sailaway. Our oldest son, 20, had signed up for his first marathon, while we were gone... We confirmed that he survived, so we were ready to set sail. 

Some views of Miami from the buffet outdoor eating area in the aft.

After lunch, we did some ship exploration and then unpacked.

First of all, the ship and room were both so beautiful! The room had a lot of storage. I used the 3 big drawers by the fridge (under the lamp on the left hand side of the picture), and Travis used the 3 of the 4 drawers in the closet. The desk in front of the lighted mirror would side in above the fridge to create a full link mirror. I slid it in most of the time to not run into it at night. I would then slide it out a little to set makeup or my curling iron while getting ready. The TV was a concern for running into it, especially at night, and I did but tried to remember.

Travis's nightstand had the two USBs and one US plug. He did not end up using them. My nightstand was oriented the other way making it narrow, so I kept pushing things off (and I do have too many bedtime things on mine). On the desk, we had 2 USB As, 2 US plugs, and a European plug. 

I liked the piece of coral though it is washed out in the picture. It had the room steward's card, and Travis had set his there after I mentioned someone on the internet saying that they always kept the keycard there. All of those doors were the closet and then storage space. The room came with an umbrella and beach bag for ports. The steward always had two towels for ports on the sofa for us. There are different towels at the towel to keep on the ship. The thermostat had settings for different lighting modes -- day, sleep, and movie. There was an all lights off and on button to not have to go around and turn them all off or on, which was nice once we figured out how to use it. We also heard from someone at dinner that you can turn the lights on or off and adjust the thermostat from the app from anywhere on the ship. We did not find a lot of use for that but was cool in concept.

The bathroom was roomy and with good storage -- don't miss the draw under the sink, it has a hair dryer in it. They provided lotion, which was nice. In the shower was body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. I read from someone that the shampoo and conditioner was drying, so I used what I brought. However, what I buy may very well be drying too. We brought some bar soap. I used some body wash. It smelled good. The strange thing was that our hand soap was a bar, so they provided that bar. I have heard a youtube note bring their own liquid hand soap because they don't like bar soap at the sink. I agree; it gets soggy and takes longer to get soap on your hands. But, when they have mentioned that, I thought that I have never had bar soap at the sink on any cruise line before. It must be a RCL thing. I took the bar soap to the shower some to use it there too.

The shower had no shower curtain and was nice and roomy. It had two hooks inside. One downfall and struggle that we had was that there was no clothes line and my suction cup clothes line did not want to stay up. With Travis's gym clothes and wet swimwear, drying clothes was a challenge. Travis found this funny to not flush anything but a reasonable amount of paper -- "Excuse me". 

We were provided four bath towels everyday without me having to ask for an extra hair towel. There was also a nightlight under the sink in the bathroom, which was handy at night.

Also, classy or traditional cruise, we received a tasty chocolate each night on the bed with our "Celebrity Today" daily program. They provide twice a day service with a morning cleaning and turn down at night. 

Christmas decorations! The plastic trees outside The Club turned different colors; I did not get the picture on a very exciting color. The martini bar had the big tree and garland. Decoration in the buffet, and a tray of Christmas cakes that just rolled in and left one day.
