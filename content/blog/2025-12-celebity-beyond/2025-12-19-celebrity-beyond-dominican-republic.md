We booked a Viator tour called: 7 Waterfalls in Puerto Plata + a Delicious Local lunch. We received information beforehand and conversations where the tour provider knew that we would be at Taíno Bay instead of Amber Cove. From the directions, I sent a follow up google map link to confirm that I found the right place to meet; however, I did not get an answer to that. It worked out; we found our tour. The instructions said to ask a guys in green shirts to call the tour company. There were too many guys in green; the first group were a taxi company. They pointed us in the right direction -- to identical green shirts. It seemed disorganized but worked. Our tour had 10 people. 

The driver offered to take a picture for us before loaded up. I did not realize how well framed they had the picture -- the ship, the port name, the palm trees, and us. I think they planned that :).

We talked to a couple their honeymoon on the ride. They were lawyers who meet in college in NY and now living in DC. Also, crazy, our van was hit by a big work truck with a cattle guard to protect it. They had a heated debate -- the driver of the work truck and two people from our tour company. Our driver came back and left the other guy to continue the wreck insurance info exchange. He asked if we were okay. I was right in front of where it was hit. My back was a little iffy; I heard that it could hurt more later. No issues later; I was fine. 

After we arrived in the waterfall park area, we were given lockers for all of our stuff. We were assigned guides at the waterfall slides and jumping activity park. Our driver was not going to participate. It makes sense, but I had not thought about it. We were issued helmets and life jackets. 

We left our phones behind; however, later the guides offered to carry them in their waterproof bags. So, no pictures. This one the guide took of us, though not flattering of me. The guide was using Apple airdrop to send them to the families. We have androids and never got up to him to get our pictures. Someone on the bus shared this one with us. He tried to send all but Travis must have mistyped his email address or the email was too large because we only got one.

We had a 45 minutes hike, much uphill, to the river. Our driver gave us each a water bottle when we got out of the van. The guides showed us how to connect the helmet our life jacket and put the water bottle in it while we hiked -- a cup holder. We got to a point in the hike when the guide said that we have to finish the water, and they had a trashcan to dispose of it. In this group, which was larger than our 10 from the cruise port, we had a group of five younger guys complaining that they had no water. So, now, we had to guzzle our water in front of them. Maybe they were staying in the Dominican Republic. It sounds like they did not plan for their water needs. 

We finished the hike and arrived at the river with chattering of how cold it will be. We had a straight down ladder to enter the river, so a little time to get deeper and adjust. It was not too bad. I'm more tolerant of cold water now than when I was younger. I could not get all the way into the 68 F at Barton Springs in Austin. I still need a hot shower though. 

We did three slides and then a choice of another slide or jump. They also allowed people to do both. After our jump off the bridge whitewater rafting in Washington with the kids, I only opted to slide. Some of the slides still quite a drop off, but it was still fun! 

Walking back, my feet were killing me with each rock that I stepped on. I just had water socks with thin soles, so they were bad for hiking, though only affected me on the walk back. Others had crocs, which they did not seem to fall off; they are nice and thick and probably felt much better. However, they take up a lot of space in the suitcases. 

My feet were happy when we finally make it back. They had a restroom that we each visited. I could change into my athletic shoes. This is when we tipped and pictures were shared. Then our guide was asking if we were ready to eat. He kept saying that we would see the guide again to get the pictures, but I did not after we ate. 

The food was buffet style, and then I sat where water bottles were on the tables. I did not see anything else to get one. I was not as impressed with this local food; I liked the Costa Rica food better from our tour on the previous cruise. Travis liked it but also said Costa Rica was better too.

Views and Christmas decorations from the buffet.

After eating, we rode back to the cruise port. I tried to peek at the wreck, but he noted that it was a different van. So, he changed it out while we were in the activity. 

The port was fancy or specialty built out port area. Some annoying vendors were trying to start a conversation or get you in the store by asking if we were from Turkey -- huh, but two of they did it for different countries. They do have a cruise guest only free lazy river; someone noted a tips jar for those that used it. 

Christmas tree right at the port entrance.

We then got back on the ship for showers.
