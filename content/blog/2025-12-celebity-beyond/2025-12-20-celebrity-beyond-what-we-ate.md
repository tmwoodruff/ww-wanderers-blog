**Buffet Lunch - Day 1**

I got cinnamon ice cream, which I had never had before. It was good; I got it another day on the buffet too. I think this was the only day with a chocolate chip at the ice cream station at the buffet. They were available at the Cafe Al Bacio. Travis had a good chocolate cake.

I also got a beef patty that had a good flavor and a pork chop. Travis had Indian and pizza.

**MDR Dinner - Day 1**

The first night we picked Cyprus, Greek restaurant; it was very good! On the app before the cruise, we showed late dining. I tried to change to early dining and learned that we had anytime dining. This was great for us. They noted it was busiest from 6-7pm, so not recommended then. We went about 5:30 each night. 

Bread 

The bread was good and the three spreads each night were so good. Butter in the middle, sun-dried tomato with a mayo base that was great at the bottom. I forgot the top one. They rotated on the different nights. There was a chive one, an onion one, and hummus on other nights.

Travis had a berry cake and an Indian dessert of carrots and raisins from the buffet for a post-show/gameshow snack that he said was very good.

**Eden Breakfast - Day 2**

Eden was very nice for breakfast. It was calm and quieter, though there was one family that brought their three kids a couple of days that we went. The kids liked to swing on the Eden swing and yell across the room for a sibling to come over. But, very nice for breakfast. 

The cinnamon roll was very good! Though she always gave me the ugliest one or the one with least icing. I'm not sure why. They also had sandwiches, which you had to order and give your name. She could never get "Tammy" for me, so I was always "Tim" or "Timmy". This was the steak, egg, bagel sandwich. All the breakfast sandwiches that I had (steak, ham, and bacon) were very good. Though I should not have ordered bacon; I think that I meant to order ham and forgot on the spot. Just too much bacon, so too much grease. Travis had muesli this morning; I took the picture too late.

**Buffet Lunch - Day 2**

For lunch a made a fajita; it was good. They had a buffet section each day with build your own taco, fajita, nachos, etc. 

The beef and rice was not as good as I hoped. It looked like the Beef Tapa that I liked on Princess, which I learned after researching at home is a Pilipino dish, but it was not the same.

**MDR Dinner - Day 2**

This was our first of two formal nights. There was a Welcome event in Eden, without too many people, before dinner that we went to. They handed out a drink. The bigger Welcome event was at 10am, but I misread the invite and almost missed it. I was late to it and was just going to Eden to sit and read while Travis was at the gym. It was a lucky find because I got to see a preview of the Eden acrobats' show. All this to say that I expect more fanfare on formal night, and there was not much unless one attended the 5pm Welcome event. There was more fanfare and fancier food on the second formal night. While off topic, I was disappointed that the Eden shows were always late -- 10:30pm or 10:45pm on nights with early port days the next day or on lose an hour of sleep days. They do not have much seating, so I think that they are trying to keep the attendance down, but really disappointing. Now, back to food. 

We went to Normandie, the French restaurant, tonight. 

Appetizer
- Normandie exclusive: Baked Brie - very good, so good that I got it another later in the cruise. Unfortunately, it is very heavy with a lot of cheese, but was so good. 
- Normandie exclusive: Coquilles Saint-Jaques - creamy with seafood - good

**Buffet Breakfast and Lunch - Day 3**

We thought the buffet would be crowded for breakfast since it was busy at lunch the day before, but it was not bad. Today's buffet lunch them was American grill. It was good. I enjoyed the grilled fish with cream sauce and honey flavored chicken. 

**Tea time Buffet - Day 3**

Tea time was at 3:30pm and seemed late. Travis likes to have his tea at 3pm for caffeine and sleeping schedules. So, they set out the tea time food with Saran wrap in front of it. So, people start to ask for them to hand them the food, which I saw them do once. Then they started saying that it opens at 3:30pm. Travis's tea time desserts and my donut.

Appetizer
- Asian Consomme with chicken and mushrooms - very good. I just did not eat the mushrooms.  
- Garden Fresh Salad - good

Main
- Pan-Seared Aged Sirloin Steak - good, but was not as good as the New York Sirloin from the night before. Though on the right of the plate, I bit into what I thought was a potato and had the scary realization that I have to spit this out. I could not keep eating and swallow it. We had been talking to the lady at the table next to us. (It was nice, with close tables, to talk and meet others at dinner.) However, she had a special diet, same table each night, and so frequently had the waiters there. They were near when I needed to spit. I just had to do it. I decided that it must have been a white beet; Travis later suggested maybe a parsnip. I only knew that it tasted like dirt.   
- Roasted Pork Loin - very good

{% image "https://assets.ww-wanderers.cc/images/2025-12-20/IMG_20251216_181144268_HDR.1536x2048.webp", "1536x2048" %}

Desserts
- Lava cake with coffee ice cream - the lava cake was very good; the coffee flavor in the ice cream was a little overpowering. 
- Peach almond frozen cream - very good 
- Panna Cotta Alla Romana - since I was taking pictures; the lady next to us shared a bit of hers and let me get a picture.

- Tuscan Exclusive: Slow Roasted Herbed Tuscan Pork Chop - very good, but not the Farro stew; I tried but did not eat it.    
- Cajun-Spiced Drum Fish - very good

Desserts
- Apple Tarte Tatin - good, with bonus ice cream because Travis did not pay enough attention that it already came with ice cream. 
- Chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream - very good

**MDR Breakfast - Day 8**

I had the smoked salmon bagel, and Travis had a fruit plate and waffle. 


Food was very good on Celebrity. The buffet had a huge selection. 

I never order the salmon in the MDR from the everyday menu. I intended to, but had a disappointing salmon in the buffet that day, so did not want to brave it. I did have the smoked salmon, bagel, and cream cheese several mornings, and it was always good.  

We ate way too much.
