We planned to visit the two forts that are National Historic Sites: Castillo San Felipe del Morro (El Morro) and Castillo San Cristóbal. We missed them in 2020 when our cruise could not return to Puerto Rico with the covid start. It was pretty crazy because the Captain also requested that if we cannot dock and disembark to at least let the Puerto Rican citizens disembark. They were not allowed to, and we were allowed into Miami. So, the Puerto Rican citizens had to sail 2.5 more days and then fly home -- that is not safer. All was fine, no known illness on the ship, and we came home healthy. Carnival took good care of us. However, we had planned the forts and the rainforest on our return, and the forts were easier to accomplish this time. 

We found the expected entrance, which was on the water; however, this entrance was closed. When we did get in, we could see the construction that caused the closure. 

We were unsure if we could find an open entrance, but Travis found it. Some pictures along the way. It is so pretty being by the ocean.

The admission was $10 each for both forts; you just had to show the receipt at the second for admission. A group was trying to enter with a beer and energy drink and told that they could not -- just water. They were finishing the drinks to enter. I had not really thought about what drinks would be allowed. A recommendation on the site was to bring a picnic -- which I forgot -- but I would not have though about that. 

With the entrance fee, we got a map; sorry that it did not scan well. I got the National Park passport book stamps in the bookstore. They also had restrooms.

Soon after getting in, we noticed and joined an in-progress Ranger-led tour, which always provides lots of good info. We learned about the indigenous people, the Taíno. Our guide, the Ranger, was part Taíno. I also learned on google AI that words from their language that we use today include "hammock," "tobacco," and "hurricane". Interesting.

This section had pictures drawn that the Ranger pointed out, but I can't them in the picture. A bunk room.

The kitchen. I thought the stalactites in the man-made cave kitchen were cool. The ovens.

We were at the first fort, El Morro, with a large senior high school field trip. They did not go to the second; though maybe they were there first. 

Wall at the top. The circular staircase. A great view down. We learned on the tour that that these semi-circles held the cannons.

The triangular staircase was closed. Not sure what a triangular staircase is. More cannons and cannon shot openings.

This is a related fort on Isla de Cabras National Historic Site and a write up about it.

Back to El Morro, the latrine. The prison.

We found the fancy cemetery, which is right by the ocean.

Then we walked to the second fort.

Capitol building and other views from the fort. This fort had an interesting display about the different European countries' control of the Caribbean. In the beginning, Spain controlled almost all of the Caribbean.

Bunks

Games the soldiers played. A well.

After the second fort, the walk back to the ship was a pretty straight shot; we went back.
