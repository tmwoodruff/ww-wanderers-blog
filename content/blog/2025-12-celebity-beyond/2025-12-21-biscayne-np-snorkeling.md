After disembarkation, we walked out of the port again -- back to terminal E, so closer terminal and cooler/earlier in the day. We had booked Nannybag (the tags that they put on our cases said Bounce, so associated with Bounce, but it was cheaper at Nannybags) at Palm Smoke Shop 3. We were there a few minutes before it opened so went to see the Berlin wall display. It brought back memories of our 2004 trip to Berlin, so long ago. The bag storage was scheduled to open at 9am, but he was late. After 15 minutes late, I tried the number as a text and then a call. No answer to either. We waited longer but started to look for other options. However, fewer options were open on a Sunday morning. We should have time to get to our tour, but you never know what other delays could occur. He walked up about 9:30am to do the unlocking. He started up the systems, and then check in our bags.

From here, we walked to the train; we were riding down to the Coconut Grove station. I did not get my video, so no picture, but while waiting for the train, hundreds of motorcycles and dirt bikes went down the highway in front of us in a big group. Popping wheelings and even a couple of four wheelers. Many did not look too street legal, but they were a site to see. 

We arrived in Cococut Grove, south of Miami, with time to kill, so we went to Below 5 and Target and got some snacks for the hotel and flight tomorrow. At lunchtime, we went across the highway to Pinecrest Bakery - Coconut Grove that we found online before with good reviews and several people outside of it making it looking very liked. They had baked goods, but the Mexican food -- we got a ham and also a chicken croquet, a cheese tequeno, and chicken empanada -- looked tastier. They took it from the case and had it warmed. The place had take a number for service. They were good.   

I pre-booked the afternoon snorkeling tour from the Biscayne National Park Institute at Coconut Grove, also near Dinner Key for finding the parking lot or finding it on google maps, since this location was closer to Miami. They also offer tours from Homestead, which is where the Visitor Center is. Homestead is where we stayed when we went to the Everglades, so with more time and an interest, you could visit both. I felt like the snorkeling tour was expensive. We also added the fin rental, for $6 each, after we could not fit ours into our suitcase; fins were required. Travis also asked if we would be cold without a shorty wetsuit, so we rented this too while there - $10 each.   

We needed to be there at 1pm, 30 minutes before the tour. We were to meet at this flag. The palm tree pictures is from the shady place that we found to sit while waiting -- they had covered picnic tables. I took my seasick meds the required times before and was good.

At the meeting time, the captain marked us off the list and sent us to his partner who issued the gear. We needed to try on our fins and shorty wet suits. When everyone was ready, we boarded. I believe that the tour could hold up to 25 people, per the website, but we had fewer.  

Our captain gave us lots of safety information before we depart; more than I have ever gotten on any boat trip. He told us how to use the radio, see our gps location, and relay it on the radio or the automated system, which would call for help and share the location but not what the emergency was. 

Then we were off. Our guide, Janet, who distributed the snorkeling equipment from their trailer on land, gave a narration and what to expect on the tour. This was while the boat was going slow in the no wake or low speed required area of the bay. After the the captain sped up, it would not be easy to hear, even with her microphone.

Island and lighthouse that are part of the Biscayne National Park. One can pay a docking fee to bring their own boat and pay a camping fee to stay overnight on the island. Our tour did not stop at the island. The park is 95% underwater.

We would have two stops. I do not remember their names. The first was out in the ocean. Before going in, they described that we wanted to be in the dark spots. So, if you see sand, look at it and then move on. That we were here to see the coral areas. They passed out the inflatable snorkeling life jackets, that you could also get a pool noodle and to put it under your life jacket, and defogger for the masks (this is water with a drop of baby shampoo). 

This spot was harder to swim at with the currents, but this stop was my favorite for the pretty fish. At our second stop, the goal was to get as close to the shore as possible -- shallow areas with many fish nurseries. Here she recommended staying horizontal to scare the baby fish less. She said that the pool noodle would really help with this. I took one this time. I did not manage to get too shallow. I normally try to avoid coral because touching or bumping into it kills it and scratches you. This was primarily grass, but I was still tried to avoid touching it and why I did not get too shallow. I did see many schools of baby fish. Travis managed to find the puffin and did get very shallow. She mentioned that they have seen seahorses in this area, but I did not hear of anyone on our boat who found a seahorse. Before any of us got in the water, they pointed out a dark spot in the water that was an eagle (sting)ray. Though I did not see any while snorkeling. This stop was Travis's favorite. She asked everyone their favorite on the way back. 

Back, we worked on drying off and getting our normal shoes back on. I picked an empty seat section (2 seats, I think) while Travis visited the port-a-potty. This family came up and took over my space. The old, large father invaded my space and then proceeded to put a towel around his waist, drop his swim trousers, and get dressed under the towel. Gross! This ran me off; how inconsiderate. I went to use the port-a-potty, though I hate port-a-potties the most. One couple was changing in them; since I try to fully avoid them, I cannot imagine trying to change in one. However, since we did not change, we later had to ride the train and an Uber wet. We talked them after they were out, asking where they were from. They were from Finland; cool. I asked about their US travels. 

We then walked back to the train station, trying to dry off as we walked. There were warnings to bring a waterproof bag. We just had our backpacks. I put some items in a big ziplock bag that Travis had. They also provided a dry box which some people used after spot 1. It was hard to keep your stuff dry when you were all wet. We also had a trash sack that we always have in our suitcase for it starts to rain when we are out with them. I did not like the trash sack much because it whipped too much in the wind with the boat moving fast -- I noticed 49-53 miles per hour on the speedometer, but probably in nautical miles per hour. They provided water bottles and water to refill bottles that we brought to save a throw away water bottle. 

We took the train back to the same area near the Port of Miami and picked up our luggage. From here, the bus frequency and time on the bus was going to be slow, so we decided to Uber but needed to find a good place to catch an Uber. The first road that we were on looked to just have buses, like bus lanes to drop off at the train station. On the map, there was an Autozone close; I said parking lot, well lit, and going the right direction. When we got there, it was closed down with a fence up and no lights -- it was dark by this time and this was a sketchy area. We walked a little more down the street to some buildings with lights and ordered an Uber. Even though we were on the correct side of the street for the direction that we wanted to go, he came from and stopped on the wrong side of the road -- eek. He started out normal, and then started cursing and talking badly about residents of different states. Travis was saying a huh, but I was not saying anything. Read the room dude. 

We were staying at the Ramada, just north of the airport, but a McDonald's was right next door. While not normally our first choice, we headed there first to grab some dinner. After ordering, Travis waited for the food, and I walked back to check-in. He came with the food before I was to the front of the line for check-in. No issues with the hotel; cute London telephone booth downstairs. They had more of the good Wyndham MSC-smelling scent products that I had liked at the La Quinta. We learned the shuttle was on the hour as first-come, first-serve. We were up early and down about 30 minutes early, 4:30 am, so we decided to Uber instead. It took the driver some time to get there; this is never in the Uber app time estimate. However, once we were in, he was in and out of traffic and got us there fast. So, we did not get to use either of the complimentary airport hotel shuttles that we found. It was Dec 22nd, and we did not know how busy the airport would be with holiday travel. From the looks of the not yet open TSA pre-check line, it looked bad. However, the regular line was open and not bad at all. I'm not sure why people were waiting in a long, non-moving/not open line just for TSA pre-check (or why the pre-check line was not open). 

That was our first Celebrity cruise and new national park visit to Biscayne. Next up...Ireland in Spring 2026.
