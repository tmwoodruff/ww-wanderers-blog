**August 30, 2025 -** This was our first A&M; game, and they noted that it was the 6th most attended game in history with 107K people, eek, that's a crowd when I would not have guessed it as a super popular opponent team to go see. Maybe because it was the first game of the year. 

Joel at Squad 3 Thunderbirds BBQ with fajitas in his new Thunderbirds cap.

Joel is a row and 3 over in from the row with the girl in the white dress, looking at his phone. Another looking up. Later the girl in the white dress left, so he was harder to find.
