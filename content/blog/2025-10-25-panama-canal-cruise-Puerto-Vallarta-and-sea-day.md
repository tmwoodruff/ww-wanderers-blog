For Puerto Vallarta, we planned a self-guided taco tour. This is similar to how we ate in Mexico City, visiting different food trucks. I found the price and highly rated ones on google maps beforehand. 

Trying to get a picture of the birds. A pelican. Then the famous Walmart and Sam's photo bombed.

Our ship is being chased by the paparazzi. Approaching the dock. A resort near the port.

We first stopped at Walmart near the port. I had discovered that I lost my sleeping eye mask by now. I must have left it on Queen Mary. I also broke my white pearl earrings the first night on the cruise. So, I was hoping to find these two items. Travis asked in Spanish at the pharmacy if they had eye masks, after we were not finding any, while I made a head laying on praying hands sleeping gesture. They said no. We scanned the whole store, and Travis got on the wifi to search in store on their web site (the US Walmart app will not find non-US stores; I tried that earlier). He found some showing in the baby section. We finally found one option on clearance that was a kid's face size that came with an airplane neck pillow -- so was a kid's travel set. I did not try it, thinking it would be too small. This Walmart also did not carry jewelry either. We got some candy to bring home and some cold sodas to drink with our taco tour. We also went to the ATM for Pesos before our tour for PV and Huatulco.

Our tour was primarily along the street that ran parallel behind Walmart. My nominated 1st place taco was the Birria taco, which has red sauce with shredded beef or pork. At this stop, we also had the Asaba taco, which is beef chucks and pinto beans. Both had lettuce, onion, cilantro. My nominated 2nd place was a fake quesadilla. Only I call it fake because queso means cheese, but quesadillas in Mexico have only a little or no cheese. It also had Birria with a little cheese, cabbage, onion, and cilantro. From a physical restaurant, we also had Chicken Flautas. For dessert, we got Oreo ice cream from a stand; it was not very creamy, but more grainy, so not so good, but nice and cold. It was warm at all of our ports, being closer to the equator. The Panama Canal is only 620 miles from the equator. We were supposed to have rain most days, but did not. There was a brief downpour when we were in Costa Rica, while we were inside eating. It was cloudier in Panama and Costa Rica, so we did not have the hot sun beating down. We then walked back to the ship. 

 Interesting palm tree growth. Back of the ship. It needs a lot more windows on the aft for good viewing. I do not know why it has all of these solid walls. It is also not very attractive.

Back on the ship, we got some gelato and soft-serve ice cream at Swirls.

On our sea day, they did a food carving demonstration, like they display in the buffet.

My sunset pictures from the MDR at dinner. We were next to the window. They are all very different colors. Unfortunately, the sun went behind the clouds in the last picture, so I did not see the green flash when it set on the ocean.
