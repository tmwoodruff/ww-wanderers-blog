We re-entered Texas and then onto Palo Duro Canyon. It was south and a little east of Amarillo. We paid at the entrance gate (they gave us a flier for a festival that they were having tomorrow) and stopped at the visitor center. The visitor center had a gift shop, some displays, and a restroom. It was steep downhill and back up to the visitor center parking. We then hiked the CCC trail -- noted as 1.4 miles one-way, 1.5 hrs, and difficult. The popular trail is the Lighthouse trail that is a lighthouse rock formation, but is 2.8 miles one-way, which we did not think we had the time or energy for. 

On the CCC trail, you are supposed to look for four bridges built by the CCC. We found one, and maybe only because we went off the main trail and could see the bottom that it was a bridge (first picture). This trail went to the area that they were setting up for the festival tomorrow. Second picture, we some almost hoodoos in Texas.

After the hike, we stopped by the visitor center one more time and then headed toward our last hotel on the trip: American Inn and Suites in Childress, TX. This was closer to our house than the previous hotel, so we did not have as long of a drive the next day. We stopped by and visited my sister at work since it was on the way home. 

Very pretty canyons, petrified wood, and lava to visit!
