Yay, embarkation day! 

We bought new Metro tickets and took the Metro from Omonia (Ομόνοια) on the M1 to Piraeus. Then we walked to bus stop to catch bus 831, where we could use the same Metro ticket. Travis researched the bus options extensively the night before. There were a couple other buses that came to the same stop and went to the port; however, this was the first that came by and stopped. Our youngest found a 5 Euro bill and was excited. We were asking if it was others around us, but with no owner, he was excited to get to buy a souvenir later in the trip. 

Our cruise check in time was 11:30 am and from Athens took about an hour or a little less. I saw the 11 am check in time available, but it was to 11:30 am by the time we got through the registration, which opens 21 days before your cruise. The online check in was more difficult than usual. Click the Eurofin covid test link, and it opens in a new window. Don't right click and open in a new tab because it cannot tell that was opened so does not consider the registration all complete. Even after registering on Eurofins for the four of us, Travis doing half, mine did not recognize that I used the link. Also, we watched the safety video with each person's registration. We watched it again before leaving home. While in Athens, we kept getting emails to watch it, but it had no tracking that we did. We watched it many times.

We caught the bus and finished walking to the port. We read about a shuttle between the main port terminal to ours at B (furthest away), but Travis got us off the bus closer to ours. 

Walking to the cruise port with a pretty bell tower.

There was a guard at the entrance letting taxis in, but there did not seem to a process for walkers. However, we could a sidewalk available. After trying to signal, "can we go?" We started to head to the sidewalk, she stopped us, we showed her our cruise luggage tags, and she said to go. Maybe they don't get many walkers?

The kids in front of the ship; the first sighting is always very exciting.

Then the process began, first tent show vaccine cards, passports, and covid test results taken in Greece. They told us that we had retake the test at the port since it was not from the last 24 hours. The web site said 3 days before allowed for international cruises. So, they noted this was good to get through their line, but still had to take a test. NCL had taken the Greece required at port test from the web site / sail safe / country specific before we left home, but now was still requiring it. It was disappointing, especially after how long we had to wait for the Greek pharmacy to get our tests correct. Though NCL paid for this test and provided another complimentary to fly back the US at the end of the cruise. Dropped off luggage; not sure how we would have gotten it back if we did fail the covid tests. Next, we went into the already registered for Eurofin line and had to show Eurofins QR codes for everyone for the port covid tests. Then inside had to show passport and vaccine cards again. Then have Eurofin QR codes scanned, passports checked, and handed our test vial and passport stickered with our assigned covide test number. Then given a color card and went to sit down until that color was called for the tests. My test was quick and gentle; Travis's was thorough. Then wait for results, which was based on number on our passport. We had to wait for everyone in our group's test results to show up, which were very spaced out. Then they gave us each a bracelet when our number came up and were negative. Finally, we could go to check in. This was quick, no line, and only one person checking our passports while someone else brought over our keycards. I had the boarding passes, but I'm not sure that he looked at it much (though it had a barcode that could be scan), it was secondary to our passports. Very lastly, through security. On boarding, they had water in the first tent before the tests, but nothing in the waiting for results tent, which took longer. 

Yay, then we walked right on, and our cruise vacation begins! As soon as getting on, they sent us to our muster station to complete our muster process. Cruise lines have greatly improved the muster process, but they cannot get everyone to go -- others trying to ruin the improvement for all of us. So, they were catching people on their way in and sending them right away. Ours was the Grand Pacifica/aft main dining room (MDR). They scanned all our cards, and we were done + a long safety announcement later about all the safety procedures and the to go to your muster station horns.

I wanted the MDR for lunch, and we were there. However, it was not open and only had a preview of the night's dinner menu. So, we went to O'Sheehan's instead. We were on before 12:30 pm but close; rooms were announced ready while we were still eating, probably about 1pm. All of the crew were wonderful, and we were so happy to be back to cruising!

We headed to our room next, while the kids were guessing that we were on deck 8 and telling them that we were on 10 instead. The window was closed with the curtain to keep the cool in, so they did not even notice the surprise, and I had to point it out. Our luggage had already arrived too? We unpacked, went to explore the ship, and to the buffet to let Travis get some Indian food and dessert for all (though the kids already had one at O'Sheehan's). 

Sail away; they had a little trouble unmooring us.

Checking out the wake in our evening walk around the promenade deck:

Our room got crowded in the evening when the kids' beds were out and down. Our room steward came back in the evening because she left the key that opened the pull down bunk. She told Travis how to put them back up in the morning, so he did that everyday. Then every evening she had to take them back out. She kept us in plenty of towels (I like a hair towel), but never remembered our ice requested the first night too. Also, no towel animals. I know that NCL does not do this anymore and that it is a lot of work for the room stewards who work very hard anyway, but it is sad to lose a nicety or part of the cruise experience.

A great first day!
