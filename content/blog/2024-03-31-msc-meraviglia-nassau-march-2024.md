We did not rush to port on our Nassau day. We had buffet breakfast, and the guys did the rope course. Then they tried the F1 simulator. There is a 50% discount per Gold member; she hinted at this but did not really explain it. So, we missed our discount on the second kid, putting them on the same card--grr. Joel won. Lastly, they did the 4D theater--the Carnival show, and Joel won again. The roller coaster simulator was currently not working. We used some onboard credit since this was Joel's trip. The onboard credit did take about a day to show up (though I could see it, bought by the Travel Agent, on our boarding papers) and then only showed on Travis's account since he put in the credit card info.

Atlantis and a super yacht (which later birthed a mini boat, in the same color, from a side door) -- taken from our room. We had lunch in the buffet before getting off. I took a picture of my plate since the nachos, Caribbean themed and were in the buffet for a few days, were so good. I also found my first mozzarella ball. The veal parm sounded good, but I did not like it, Travis thought it was good.

We were docked next to another MSC ship that was a little smaller than ours and also next to our friends on the Anthem of the Seas, which was much bigger than us and had the North Star going. At the port, they had wifi, but we did not have any luck getting in when we got off. When getting back on, we did get in, and Owen heard from a friend that we were getting baseball sized hail at home (eek -- on our new roof!)

Here is the Junkaroo museum; it is right in the new port area. Then we walked to the Queen's Staircase. The dug out or sunken in area before it was cool; though the actual staircase was not very exciting. At the top though, they had a fort that was cool. It cost to get in. We just walked around it.

This guy found a unique position in a hole in the fort.

Then we walked to the shopping area, which had many tourists. We read the US State Dept warnings before going, so many tourist around is good. We wanted some Baskin Robbins ice cream, but it was just a Dunkin Donut, the Baskin Robbins was no longer included. So, we went back at the port. Here is a picture of the new port area. I also took a picture of a Carnival ship in port because it was pretty reflecting off the water. However, it does not look as good in the picture. We used the wifi some before returning to our ship.

It was Caribbean night at the MDR. I tried to get nachos, but our waiter kept saying quesadillas and I end up with quesadillas. Owen ordered both and gave me one nacho. It was good, but really was so small that he did not have much to share. Travis's bean and chorizo soup was alright; he did not find any chorizo.

The kids and I all ordered the BBQ pork ribs. They were very good and very messy. One of the restaurant managers brought me an extra napkin, which was nice of her. She stopped to check on each table every night to be sure things were going well. When finishing, I went out of the restaurant to the restroom to wash my hands -- just too sticky. Travis's shrimp and cheddar grits, which he said was quite good (not the British "quite", but really very good).

Joel and Owen got the key lime pie; they noted that it was interesting but that they liked it. They probably have not had key lime pie before. I had Grandma's chocolate cake, and Travis had the Caribbean rum cake.

After dinner, the Nassau sail away from the one view point on the promenade deck. There were some good views though. Then the sunset and moon.
