Our train arrived at Rome Termini. We walked past many luggage storage places with listed prices near the train station. We booked Roman Terrace at Via Daniele Manin, 69 - 00185 Rome directly on their website. It was noted that they would store luggage. We buzzed in at the large, wood carved, double doors. We then had some confusion after seeing the front desk. It had a different name, and Travis noted that the desk looked like a doctor's office -- hehe. We went back downstairs and buzzed again. He said that we saw him and left. Doh. We went back up. He collected the Rome city fee and required cash only; 6 EURs each. He was very helpful and noted our room was ready -- at 10am; this far excessed our expectations. He demonstrated all the keys. There was a shared microwave, fridge, filtered water (I'm going with that it was filtered, at least), a fancy coffee/espresso machine, and outside terrace. There was also a tea kettle, biscuits, candy, and a fridge in the room. Travis did not recommend the candy, so I did not try it. Everything else was tasty and not expected or promised. They provided ear plugs noting a tram that would be loud outside. We saw the track when we were going in. We don't think that we heard it at all, but we did use the earplugs. The bathroom was long and narrow, the length of the room. My only complaint on the room or the stay was nowhere to put toiletries and soap in the shower. We still had our bar soap bought for the cruise and used this. It looked like they previously had shelves in the shower because there were some holes in the tile. We had four pillows, with two extras provided in the closet. Room pictures and the view.

We got on the wifi to determine where to start exploring from the google map pinned items. We visited the restroom and set out. 

Our first destination was Trevi fountain; I say destination because there was more awesome on the way. There were two cathedrals that we passed close to our hotel. The fountain was currently drained of water, so that was a bummer. I have since seen a news article about the work completion and water being back. Construction was the theme in Rome in preparation for the Church's 2025 Jubilee declared by the Pope. The construction covers were good about having a print what the buildings behind looked like, so you could imagine it. Trevi fountain had a line setup, so that you can stand in line and walk through to get a closer view. We just looked from further back.

Next, we found the Spanish steps and the beautiful cathedral behind it. I had fond memories of the Spanish steps from a previous trip (25 years ago). This time we approached from the right side so did not get the big "wow" feel when we first saw it. We got it later when leaving and turned around to look and get a picture (below). This is from the street with many expensive stores. There were more cars driving down it than I expected too. Before that a view from the cathedral's height.

We found the Lego store. Then it was on to the Castel Sant'Angelo, which was under construction with the pictures of what it would look like.

We then started looking for some lunch. We checked out a few places and decided to go look in a grocery store. In the back, of a fairly small grocery store, there was a deli with a guy making sandwiches. It at first felt like a pushy sells experience, but after he let us just look at the options better, we opted for them. They were very good and affordable. Like the sandwich in Croatia, it had cream cheese spread on the bread. Maybe I need to start making sandwiches this way; I'm not a big sandwich fan, but like them if they have good bread. The grocery store was[ Affiliato Carrefour Express](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Via+della+Fontanella+di+Borghese,+20,+00186+Roma+RM,+Italy/@41.903912,12.4744341,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f6056b45fb1d3:0x50e0cc0840fbd4dd!8m2!3d41.903908!4d12.4770144!16s%2Fg%2F11gxxgvzlh!5m1!1e1?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), and sandwiches were 3.50 EUR each. I also got some cashews. This sandwich had good bread and local cheese and meat. I could also get one without vegetables that I don't like on my sandwich. It was very delicious, though challenging to eat -- bread and full sandwich was thick and hard to bit, but worth it. I saw in a guidebook not to eat (picnic) at major tourist sites, and we did not come across a park. We ate in front of a church; someone else was already there doing it too. Travis thought that I was crazy then found it in the guidebook too and churches were also included. That makes sense; I just did not remember that. We moved along quickly after finding that. We saved part of the sandwiches for later and headed toward the Vatican.

We went to see the outside of the St. Peter's Basilica. You can pre-buy skip-the-line tickets, buy from a vendor walking around there, or wait in the line. We did not go in; it looked very crowded. I had been and to the museums.

We saw some important people come up, and the Swiss guards were protecting.

Church Holy Spirit in Sassia (called this, but it is in Rome). I was impressed by this car, so got some pictures.

We continued walking up to an overlook and got these views. Across from the overlook was this fountain. A lady set up equipment and recorded a news story either for the news or for social media. I don't know how she tunes everything else out. This area was being guarded by some military men and their truck; I don't know why.

River Tiber -- it had construction in progress too, so we could not walk down beside it. The views.

"Birthday cake" or officially called: Monument to Victor Emmanuel II. This was one of my favorites to see on my first visit.

We then attempted to catch a bus back to our hotel for a much needed restroom break. We had not found any other. We tried to go the botanical garden, which was supposed to have one, but they were closed this day, Monday. The bus stop was right below the viewpoint, but listed the same stop multiple times. We waited a while without it coming and then walked to a different stop/different bus number. This one came, and we got on to our hotel. We scanned a credit card each for the ticket; it was 1.50 EUR each. 

After the hotel stop, we walked to a park near our hotel that had bath ruins -- Baths of Trajan. However, it got dark at 5pm, and I think some people lived at the park. So, we walked back toward the hotel, looking for a restaurant for some good Italian pasta for Travis. We talked to two; they are very aggressive sellers too. Short stop at the hotel to read the google reviews, make the decision, and let it get closer to dinner time.

{% image "legacy/IMG_1224.webp", "1536x2048" %}

We went back to Sapori Di Roma near our hotel. I had pizza and water, and Travis had pasta and wine. The pizza was huge and delicious; he had some too. The pasta was a disappointment. It was 25 EURs for the meal. We ate outside, which looked like what all of the restaurants only had. The most disappointing part was that vendors came up and harassed you while you were trying to enjoy a meal. I have not run into that before. I think we had about 5 come up. A couple across from us was going to take the free thing, and I was thinking, "NOOOO". She later said that she did not have room for it, so take it back, or it would be thrown away. I have not experienced that before; it really detracts from the dining enjoyment.

We ended our day after the restaurant.
