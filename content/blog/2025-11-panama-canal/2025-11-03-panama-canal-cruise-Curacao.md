Enjoying the wake and sunset on a sea day.

Curacao from the ship. Curacao is a Dutch island with a governor that reports to and is appointed in the Netherlands. It is very close to Venezuela and part of the ABC island with Aruba and Bonaire. 

Queen Juliana Bridge for car traffic, as opposed to the Queen Emma Bridge, which on platoons, swings open, and is only for pedestrians.

We got off to meet a walking tour for tips, that I pre-registered for, at 9:30 am outside the entrance of Rif Fort Village (Harbor view). It was not too far of a walk. We were there a little early, so walked around a little more before. You walk through vendors and then arrive in Rif Fort, which is also vendors and restaurants. 

The fort. Travis had a cool fort-like pose looking out the opening. The fort and our guide showed us other places in town that had coral fossils built in.

They were starting to put up the Christmas decorations.

We met the tour guide outside the fort by the statue. He introduced himself to each person and told us to wait in the shade and sit, if possible. Before leaving, he had us all introduce ourselves. Since we were from Texas, a big Buc-ee's fan came up, and we talked about Buc-ee's. She had a Buc-ee's hip pack, and her husband had a Buc-ee's lanyard and t-shirt. She was trying to visit all of the locations; however, they are always opening new ones. For those who have not heard of Buc-ee's, it is a beyond gas station and convenient store. They have somewhere around 100 gas pumps, famously clean restrooms with lots of stalls, beef jerky, bbq and other made to order meals, the beaver mascot, having its own snack the beaver nuggets, candy, and locally made souvenirs. And apparently, a following.

We started in a square across the street with the flag and metal art pictures and a write up on that component of history for each.

Then we began exploring the colorful street art that Curacao is known for.

We stopped and sat here where this art was, while our guide went through information about Curacao. It was a hotel and restaurant. Our guide introduced us to the owner.

Then our tour stopped at several stores for shopping or samples. Some, there was not time to shop, so I guess they hoped that everyone found their way back. We had some alcohol samples. We got three chocolate samples that was made with mix in. I do not remember all, some were good and others were further out there. I believe that some were lavender, orange peel, a flower, and rose essence. This was a near a burger place that looked good. 

Pretty flowers. Some guys were unloading their catches, being sold to some local restaurants. He showed them off for us. We then went to a lionfish place. She explained that the lionfish is an invasive species that eats tons of their native fish at the reef and lay 30,000 eggs every 4 days. They are working to remove them. I bought a pair of earrings made from lionfish skin in support. Our credit card did not work, so I used cash. She did give up quickly. It worked at a grocery store later.

While still making the purchase, the tour went on to an art exhibit; we caught up later but did not see much there. We went across the Swinging Old Lady (Queen Emma Bridge) during our tour. The license plate was in the brewery. Some views.

Umbrella alley. Carillon clock; I believe that he said it played the Curacao National Anthem in one of the hours. We did get to hear it play one song. Then we stopped a glass blowing shop that had two pet tortoises. They were so cute. This is the male; the female was being shy and was hiding under a shelf.

Our tour ended at the top of a hotel. The elevator was broken, so there were several floors of stairs that we had to climb. They had an infinite pool at the top. Some views from the top.

We stopped by a grocery store to get some local snacks and a soda. I found a Christmas ornament -- sea turtle that said Curacao. Then we walked back to the ship. I have taken other post box pictures, so here is Curacao's.

Back on the ship. Goodbye Celebrity; they were in port with us.
