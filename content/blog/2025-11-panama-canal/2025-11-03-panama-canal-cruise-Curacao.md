Curacao from the ship. Curacao is a Dutch island with a governor that reports to and is appointed in the Netherlands. It is very close to Venezuela and part of the ABC island with Aruba and Bonaire. 

Queen Juliana Bridge for car traffic, as opposed to the Queen Emma Bridge, which on platoons, swings open, and is only for pedestrians.

We got off to meet a walking tour for tips, that I pre-registered for, at 9:30 am outside The entrance of Rif Fort Village (Harbor view). It was not too far of a walk. We were there a little early, so walked around a little more before. You walk through vendors and then arrive in Rif Fort, which is also vendors and restaurants. 

The fort. Travis had a cool fort-like pose looking out the opening. The fort and our guide showed us other places in town that had coral fossils built in.
