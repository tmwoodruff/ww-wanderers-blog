View from the balcony; I found mountains!

We booked a ship excursion: A Walk in the Clouds. Here is its description: 

*Explore the lush ecosystem of a cloud forest as you walk along beautiful trails with a naturalist guide. Begin with a 1 hour and 45 minute scenic drive to San Luis Park. You'll walk to the hummingbird garden, an open area where these tiny, colorful birds flit about gathering sweet nectar from blooming flowers. A series of suspension bridges cover more than a half mile of the cloud forest, and walking across them is the ultimate way to get a bird's-eye view of the ecosystem. Back on terra firma, hike alongside sparkling rivers and cascading waterfalls. Refresh at a restaurant with a traditional lunch. On your return, stop at El Jardín to admire the gardens and peruse a well-stocked souvenir shop before continuing to the ship.*

We missed El Jardín with gardens. Travis found when we were looking at an independent tour that El Jardín looked closed. So, this makes sense, though missing the gardens is sad. They did have shopping available at our lunch stop in San Luis. Not mentioned, but that I enjoyed a lot, was the birds by the lunch spot too. They put out food and were attracting them well.
 
The ship meeting place on the ship and heading outside to meet the guide felt very disorganized based on our other experience with other cruise lines. We were supposed to be in dining room at 8:30 am. You always hear not to be late, but there was no concept of late because there were long lines on both sides of the dining room with multiple different tours gathering. I had to go back to the room for my sunglasses and allergy medicine so lost our place in line. Though it did not matter. I thought at first people were saying that there were different meetings times, so the earlier times needed to be at the front of the line. Then later I decided that this was not really true. When getting to the front of the line, they gave us a colored and number sticker and walked into the dining room. I assumed until our group was called, but then we were all told to walk out, just all groups together, following the full group. Outside each tour had a sign and when they had enough people for a bus/van, they walked us to our van. Ours had 20 passengers. There were some big coaches too for other tours. So, really the process worked fine, but was not what I expected, so seemed like chaos. 

Our tour guide was very good and shared a lot about family life and government in Costa Rica, which was very interesting. As a contrast, our tour guide in Panama City did not, so I do not feel like after that I knew Panama as well. Our driver spotted some Scarlet Macaws and pulled over. We just saw their tails as they were flying away. I only got one smug picture of them flying away. 

They used trees for the posts of barbed wire fences. Once a year, they cut the tops off, and tree forms a bump there. These are not the best examples, but you can see the smaller trees growing back small at the top.

Other nice vistas from the drive. Our driver stopped at a local farmer's market with a restroom. It was a quarter to go; I had brought some US quarters but did not bring them ashore this day. The ladies got some toilet paper for their quarter; guys did not. They also served our group fresh pineapple. Produce from the market was not great because we did not have a way to wash it. Someone got a banana, which worked. One stall had cooked food. I regretted not getting a chicken tortilla wrap, but we were running low on time.

We arrived at San Luis, which had the hanging bridges and ziplining.

We left for the rainforest hike with the hanging bridges from the buildings with the restaurant, restrooms, gift shop, and food shop. They had an area in back where they put out food to attract birds. I don't have a picture, but we found the Costa Rica national bird. Of all the pretty birds, they picked a brown bird for the national bird. It does have a pretty singing voice though. Our tour guide showed us/told us about local birds and animals from a DK travel book on drive.

On the trail with welcoming heart arches.

Our guide pointed the mushroom. Then someone found a big caterpillar. It was on the trail and did not seem to be doing too well. Our guide moved it up to the side of the trail, so it would not get stepped on.

Our first bridge with a waterfall below it.

Heart of palm; they had to make it illegal to remove the heart.

Grandmas told kids to stay away from this flower -- the Angel's Trumpet -- since it is poisonous and hallucinogenic. It is pretty though.

In Costa Rica, they claim to have the best coffee. They did sell it for $22 in the gift shop. Travis had some at lunch and said that it was good. Coffee plants at an angle back in the bottom right.
