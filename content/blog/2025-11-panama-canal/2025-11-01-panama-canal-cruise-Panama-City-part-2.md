Waiting with us for the tour was a Dad from another state (that I don't remember) and then his son who went to University of Texas in Austin in our home state. After our pick up, there was one more stop at the Radisson hotel, and then our tour guide started talking.

Our driver stopped at a local farmer's market with a restroom. It was a quarter to use the restroom; I had brought some US quarters but did not bring them ashore this day. The ladies got some toilet paper for their quarter; guys did not. They also served our group fresh pineapple. Produce from the market was hard to buy and try because we did not have a way to wash it. Someone got a banana, which worked. One stall had cooked food. I regretted not getting a chicken tortilla, which I think was only $1, but we were running low on time.

The driver was the last one back and did a little grocery shopping. The guide joked that one of us would need to drive the bus. We then continued the drive to 
Gamboa where the boat dock was. 

We boarded; there were life jackets behind each seat that were noted as required by law to wear. It was a little bit of a ride out to the rainforest area where we found the monkeys on Gatun Lake. 

Travis on the boat. Seeing the terracing in the cut to prevent landslides. Watching for big ships in the lake that are going through the canal. Tugging its tug?

Herman the German that we learned to recognize in one of the two Panama Canal port talks that we attended by the ship's lecturer. It is used for lock maintenance. From wikipedia, it is one of four sister ships/crane vessels seized by the Allies at the end of World War II as part of war reparations. One is still in Hamburg considered too damaged by WWII bombings. One that the British got, sold to the French, sank off the coast of Denmark. The fourth is believed to still be in use. It was thought to be gone (not sure by who) until it was spotting working at the Admiralty Shipyard at Saint Petersburg in 2015. Some old piping.

This tug was being tossed around by the water or tossing the water around.

Our second type of monkey, howler monkey, that we had to spot in the trees. They do not come close like the other two.

Tiny bats! They hang in a line to look like a snake and scare away predators.

We came back to the Capuchin monkeys; they were not hungry and did not come out during our first stop. We fed them peanuts and one piece of mango each. They really loved the mango. They grabbed the food with their hands and then moved on. There was a little girl who loved feeding them.

The railroad, created before the canal to transport containers from ocean to ocean. It was also used to move out tons and tons of dug out dirt.

We then returned to the boat dock and back Panama City.
