**MDR Lunch - Day 1** 
I had the tenderloin; I was surprised to see this on the lunch menu. However, it was in roast form instead filet form. I came across this for other meals, except for the last formal night when I got the real thing. I do prefer the thicker filet. The potatoes had a good flavor. Travis had the chickpea soup from the appetizer list as a main. I wanted this menu again to try others things, but I only saw it one other time. Most days had the menu with the Calamari.

**MDR Dinner - Day 1**

Appetizer
- Ceviche  
- Goat cheese with vegetable antipasto

Main - Pork with rice and black beans

Desserts
- Chocolate souffle - after they poured the cream sauce over it, I decided that I might have liked it better without the sauce. The person beside us was also not impressed. 
- Lychee Raspberry Rose Mousse - we saw lychee, when I had never heard of it before, included in several dishes, so they must have gotten a bulk deal. It was good but available many nights.

**MDR Dinner - Day 2 - Italian night**

Appetizer
- Beef Carpaccio  
- Eggplant Parmesan - this was much bigger than he expected. Not pictured: Cold Raspberry Soup in a drink glass with a soup or straw. 

Main
- Veal Polpettini, Rustic Tomato Basil Sauce - pretty good, but not the best veal that I have had. 
- Seafood with garlic cream potatoes - good

Dessert
- Amaretto Crème Brûlée - good
- Chocolate Panna cotta

**MDR Lunch - Day 3**

I was excited for this version of the lunch menu for the Calamari and Monte Cristo. However, they both disappointed, so I wanted to see the day 1 lunch menu more often.

Appetizer
- Calamari - it was just too thick, so hard to eat. The sauce options were nice. 
- Thai Spring Roll

Main
- Monte Cristo - this was not fried in batter like Monte Cristos normally are and did not have a good flavor. Going back, it was just described as a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. I should have paid more attention.  
- Quinoa Salmon Poke Bowl

Dessert - Double Chocolate Tart - not pictured - good

**MDR Dinner - Day 3 - Formal Night**

I'm not sure how I missed so many pictures this day.

Appetizer
- Caesar salad - not pictured
- Crab cake - not pictured
- Gnocchi - almost eaten; Travis tried the pasta. Princess offers one or two pasta dishes each day. 

Main
- Beef Tenderloin - not pictured. This was also roast style but was tastier than the lunch version. 
- Red Snapper with black beans

Dessert 
- Chocolate sundae 
- Crepe Suzette

**Buffet Breakfast - Day 4**

I discovered the Beef Tapa and rice in the buffet for breakfast yesterday. It seemed out of place for breakfast, but I thought when in Rome. I learned after getting home that it is Filipino dish and commonly served with fried eggs too. It was very good, and I found it on other mornings too. Salmon, bagel, and cream cheese was also available in the buffet, not just in the MDR. Another buffet note for breakfast, there is no hot chocolate packets; you have to buy hot chocolate from the bar for $4. You can get included hot chocolate in the MDR.

**MDR Dinner - Day 4**

Appetizer
- Hot Smoked Salmon with potatoes, sour cream, and dill - not pictured. I was not a big fan of this, but I was trying something new.
- Pea soup, which was actually blackeye peas - not pictured - good.  

Main
- Smoked pork - it tasted more like ham, but was good, and good with the slice of bacon it was served with, and had mashed potatoes. 
- Fish

Dessert 
- Carrot cake - good  
- Chocolate Banana

**Buffet Breakfast - Day 5**

It was chocolate morning today on the buffet; the pastries all included chocolate. Though many mornings there was no chocolate, and sometimes nothing that I liked. I would have preferred one chocolate choice each day. The chocolate display was pretty, but only so many one can eat for one breakfast. Here is what I got.

Main

**Buffet Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner - Day 10**

Halloween breakfast donut and lunch Halloween dessert. 

We had popcorn (included), pizza, and ice cream while watching a Movie Under the Stars. I liked the pepperoni pizza, but tried the four cheese tonight. It did not have tomato sauce. I liked the tomato sauce, so including it is my preference. Travis had the vegetable pizza. Princess has good included pizza. I heard that their paid pizza was very good, but we did not try it.

**MDR Dinner - Day 11**

**MDR Dinner - Day 15 - Formal**

Best quality and tasting food of any night. This is what I expected of Princess food for a premium cruise line. But, this is our first Princess cruise, so maybe I have incorrect expectations. Everything was excellent and was by far the most special feeling Formal night. 

Appetizer
- Escargot 
- Wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon

Main
- Land & Sea - tenderloin filet - so good. I do not eat lobster, so Travis enjoyed it. They came around with an extra plate to remove the non-edible part of the tail and with butter. I forgot the pictures of the mains because we started talking to the people at the table next to us right before our mains arrived. I got this picture from our facebook roll call group. 
- Duck - not pictured. We both thought this was very good.  

Dessert
- Chocolate Pistachio
- Chantilly Swan

**MDR Dinner - Day 16**

Main

**MDR Breakfast - Day 16**

Since we were not in a rush to disembark, we went to the MDR for breakfast. Hot chocolate is included in the MDR but normally comes in a small tea kettle with a cup. I was served this instead; so pretty. Maybe this is the $4 on in the buffet version.
