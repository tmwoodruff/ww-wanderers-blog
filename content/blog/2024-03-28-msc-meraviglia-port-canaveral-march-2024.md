**Port Canaveral -- March 12, 2024**

We were set to arrive in Port Canaveral at 1pm, so I booked an Avis car rental, that offered a port shuttle for cruise passengers only, for 1:30pm. As it got closer, the cruise director began announcing to not gather in the public areas and that they needed 45-60 more minutes to get docked and cleared (1:30 to 1:45 pm). The shuttle will go back and forth, so I did not worry about the rental. We planned to drive to Twister Airboat rides about 25 minutes away. Then, if time, stop at the Manatee Sanctuary that was really close to Avis. 

We started the morning at the buffet since we were not blown away by the MDR for breakfast the day before. Not all this day, but the buffet had some interesting breakfast choices. I really liked a small croissant cut in half, sideways with scrambled egg and ham instead. There was also a fried cheese item; it was hard but very good. They also had a Spanish breakfast casserole that I did not try. There was an English muffin with egg and ham (but it has a bad "special" sauce on it). These both had an egg that we decided was baked, which gave the egg a very strange texture. Owen and I did not like this; the egg stuck to the front and back of your teeth from biting. It was a little freaky. But, interesting, good choices plus the normal options, except bagels (my usuals). They had bagel toppings and toasters, but not bagels. Then on the last sea day, they had them in the MDR, and I got one in the buffet on the last day. They must have stocked up at one of the ports. 

After breakfast, Travis, Owen, and I tried the rope course. We did not know about needing the waiver or where to go in, so got snapped at by the crew. They were nicer after we did it right. You have to go to the aqua park to sign the waiver and get a bracelet. Enter the long hall, past the water park heading forward, on the starboard side. He kindly gave me another, looser bracelet after I did not like the first so tight. I generally don't like rope courses that much, so only went around once. Travis and Owen went around multiple times; Travis trying with no hands -- no thank you :)!

Getting off, we walked around until we found the rental shuttle pick up. I could not find any locations maps beforehand; though found out what berth we and RCCL were assigned that day. From the port escalators down, turn back the way that you exited out but outside. If I remember right, this was also where the Uber/Lift pickup signs pointed. We found a sign, and the driver arrived shortly after. There was also a number provided to call if the shuttle was not arriving. We parked in a different spot, so he went to move his sign. He seemed to distrust that we had an Avis rental, as I was showing him the confirmation number. He got our party count and went to determine if anyone else was waiting for the shuttle. We were the only ones on that shuttle. He was entertaining. He noted that the last shuttle was 5pm, so we had to get back by 5pm (I booked the car until 6pm) or take an Uber back to the port terminal. It was a small rental operation. The guy in front of us was so slow. Then the rental guy requested an ID from us, and I gave him the confirmation number. Then he said that nothing else was needed and handed us the rental agreement and keys. I did pick the pre-pay option when booking; not really intentionally but confused or tricked by it. If our ship missed the port, it would have been a mistake. However, maybe that is why it was so fast. The gentleman working the rental desk said 5:15 or 5:30 for the last shuttle. 

  


We drove to Twister Airboat Rides that did not take reservations for the shorter airboat ride, 30 minute ride. We paid there. I had printed a $2 off per person coupon, but also grabbed one from the car rental place while perusing the coupons and waiting for the slow guy in front of us. Paying cash would have been cheaper too, but we did not have enough. They had a bar and restroom, but no displays (I wondered if they would). After paying, I realized that I should have asked the time of the tour before paying. She said 10 to 15 minutes, which surprised me. It was 10 to 15 minutes instead until the next group, that was not us, started. Before they started, he said that he needed to get more gas, which proved to be a slow process. Two were operating, so it did not take too much longer before it was our turn. We were also slow getting ready; leaving some stuff in the car, back to grab a tip to give, back to grab the paper with our group number, and sunscreening.

  


We saw tons of alligators and birds that our guide stopped and pointed out, and we got to go fast through grass in the marsh for that cool airboat feeling of seeing something different than you feel.

We originally wanted to visit the Air Force museum, near the port (since Joel has an Air Force ROTC scholarship, planning to start at Texas A&M; in the fall), but it closed at 2pm on Tuesdays when we were expected into port at 1pm. So, we did not try it. After the airboat tour, we stopped at Manatee Sanctuary. We did not see any manatees, except the statue, but we saw turtles and birds.

We stopped for gas to fill up the car and went back, making it just a few minutes before the 5pm shuttle. He noted that the shuttle was just about a minute away and seemed very confident. We were the only ones there. Twenty minutes later it pulled up with lots more people now waiting with us. Since we had waited the longest, we got on the shuttle. The other group that rode with us was on the Anthem of the Seas. After they were dropped off, the driver said that we could move forward and was very friendly too. While waiting, I noticed this lone, tall palm tree that I wanted a picture of.

With the long wait, we dressed quickly to make it dinner on time. Really, we could arrive between 6 and 6:15pm. I do not know how strictly this is enforced. A big table near us had adults arrive on time and teenagers come in 30 minutes late. This seemed like it would get the fixed dining schedule all out of whack. 

  


Travis's crab cake, my Caesar salad, and Joel's cheddar broccoli soup:

Travis ordered clam and linguini, but Ramon noted the pasta being too soft that day, so Travis changed it to the shrimp, noting going back and forth between the two options. Ramon brought both without the $5 charge. I only have a picture of the linguini. The shrimp was really good and the linguini okay. We noticed the next table sending it back. Ramon was right. My Steak Diane was pretty good (again not the same as the paid steakhouse). The kids got pulled pork and mac & cheese that Joel thought was very good and Owen did not like much.

Desserts were Dulce de Leche cake and NY cheesecake with chocolate for me and Owen had it with caramel.

Travis, Owen, and I went to Encore, the Broadway show that included songs and sections from many Broadway musicals. It was very good. Joel went to the gym instead.
