Cruise day! Because it is crazy, this cruise is exactly, to the day, 20 years after our very first cruise on the NCL Sun in Alaska. 

Our guesthouse checkout was 10am, so we needed to move quickly. We were mostly packed up from the night before. We had some time to kill before our noon NCL check in. We also had about a 45 minute bus ride, which turned out to be longer. We planned a walk to visit the bird sanctuary again because it was near, and it had a bus stop near that we planned, knowing the time that the bus should stop. We got outside -- windy! Travis noted that he did get a wind advisory on is phone. Doh, our two beautiful days' weather in Iceland was over. Then I remembered all the bird poop on the trail, but there was a greenhouse that if we could get in, we could get out of the wind. Travis had the big suitcase so rolled, but I had the smaller one so carried through the bird mess. We were able to get into the greenhouse, so looked at the plants and signs about them and watched the birds outside. When it was time, we headed to the bus stop. The bus was late when it was cold and windy, even with a little shelter, it did not help much. A couple joined us; they had been in Iceland since March. They were from Australia; their only grandchild lived here. 

When the bus arrived, we missed our bus change because the stop names were wrong in the bus. Someone was asking locals and got off at the right place; we should have ease dropped more or jumped in on the conversation. Travis saw on google maps that we were now going the wrong way. We got off at the next stop and walked to a stop for the bus number that we needed (16). We has ISK cash since the capitol area buses did not take credit cards yet. This gave you a ticket for bus changes that lasted for 75 minutes. We had to wait a long time before the scheduled arrival of 16. Once we were on, there was luggage everywhere, so we knew that we were in the right place. It was a quick ride from here; then we walked to the port. We saw the line; there was a sign but still no indication of what to do/the process. The line was back to the sign with the wind still whipping. The check in times meant nothing. The line went into a tent, almost being whipped by the wind. Reps did come by later about dropping luggage. They indicated that we should have dropped our luggage before getting in line, but then said that one person could go -- which we would have done anyway. The luggage drop was far away; nowhere near the start of the line to see it and know.

Once getting in, we found out that the long wait was for security. We forgot to pour out our water, so used their trashcans. Then later, getting back on the ship from ports, they did not care if we brought back water. I guess Iceland/Greenland cruisers are not common alcohol smugglers. 

After completing security, getting on board was quick. We found a Latitude status line with the purchased quick boarding. We could not tell if it was supposed to be two lines or one. The person checking us in had trouble getting the iPad to read the barcode on both our passports. That and boarding passes needed; no covid tests or vaccine cards required. After check in, we received our keycards and walked right on. Onboard, we were directed to muster station to check in. We watched the lifejacket video before boarding. 

With that complete, we went to lunch at O'Sheehans. My favorite but not Travis's. It was super crowded, almost full; I have never seen it that crowded on embarkation day. However, it was super fast; everything must have already been pre-made. I had loaded nachos and a burger with bacon, BBQ sauce, and said cheddar, but looked like American. I asked specifically for cheddar later. Though when we were in the grocery store in Reykjavik, we saw what was called cheddar that looked like American; they must have a different definition of cheddar in Iceland. Travis had Cobb salad and then India food from the buffet. The buffet had hard/real ice cream, and not just soft serve, yay! Travis at O'Sheehans.

After the buffet, we toured the ship/started learning our way around. It seemed very different than we were used to, and we initially were not a big fan. The bottom decks were similar, but the top decks were different. The spa and gym were in the back, and the gym had no windows to enjoy the view while working out. There were a few windows on the sides, but only visible from a few machines. The buffet was frequently very crowded. We could not get food; unless, we found a table to eat it at. Travis's rule. We could have asked to share with people; a lot of people asked us. One person asked to sit with us when the table next to us was empty. I do not mind normally, but that was weird. Then his wife sat at the empty table, so he moved to be with her. It was too cold outside and the outdoor buffet was rarely open. Though also outdoors, I missed the Great Outdoors. There was no drink stations outside; there would have been with the Great Outdoors. It was an adult only area, which would have been nice too, if were not so cold. Also, no observation lounge that; normally NCL has an awesome observation lounge high and forward. The full walk around promenade was nice. Some maintenance did closed a section during part of our cruise, but the front was always open to walk all the way around. 

The cruise ship always felt like there was no place to sit. The first day people were laying/sitting on the floor on their luggage. They must have been people who flew in that morning, landing at 6 am :(. Not something normally seen on a cruise. The rooms were ready much later than I'm used too -- 3:30 pm for a 4 pm sail away. Our sail away was moved to 5 pm for more fueling. 

At 3:30 pm, we went the room and have a few pictures without our stuff everywhere yet. We had an obstructed oceanview. Unfortunately, very obstructed. We have never seen a non-full window for the obstructed, or I would have researched better. Walking on the promenade, I only saw ours, so avoid 8106 and the one directly across from it. We could see the ocean out of the right window, though a tight squeeze with the desk. Travis had the tight squeeze, and I had to bend around the fold down bed. We had good outlets -- British and US at the desk, European and 2 USBs under the TV, and Travis had a USB by the bed on his side. I have a picture of the shower, but not the full bathroom. The bathroom was roomy with toilet with closing sliding door, sink in the middle, and shower with a sliding door. I have a picture of the shower because it had a facet for a shower/tub combo -- funny looking in our shower.

Some luggage was here but not ours. Luggage was randomly in the hall. Travis went to look for any of ours, so we could start unpacking. He found one. After we unpacked it, I decided that I would go. I attracted attention; a room steward took me to where it was being brought in. I was not sure if he wanted me to look or just believe him. I believed him that they would come. I quietly went back to our room; I was trying to make less, not more, work. Later, our room steward came by to meet us and brought it. He asked if we needed anything; we asked for ice, an extra bath towel (hair towel), and bar soap (they did not have this). We had ice most days, and I always had my extra towel. Since NCL does not do towel animals any more (sad), that cannot be an emergency back up. Overall, he was awesome and friendly each time we saw him. 

We had dinner in the aft, more formal dining room. It was slower than I expected, but it did not really feel like it at the time. Unlike in Greece, where others ate late and the dining room was not crowded, it was busy with other early eaters. Aft windows with the wake.

I had crab and cream cheese wontons; they were just okay -- too fishy of a taste for crab. Then I had sirloin medallions and fries; they were very good. Travis has a very good Greek salad and enjoyed his tilapia, not a strong flavor. We normally try different desserts, but we both could not resist the sound of the sea salt caramel chocolate tart. It was a winner and so pretty. Menus of varying quality.

And that is wrap for our first cruise day.
