**Ísafjörður****\-- July 16, 2023**

Isafjordur is also on a fjord and was a very early stop. We pre-booked Dynjandi Waterfall & the Westfjords tour from Wild Westfjords, now ArticEx. We were scheduled to arrive with a tender port at 7 am, and the tour published to start at7:30 am. Crazy! We got up super early and had O'Sheehan's breakfast. Then grabbed our pre-packed stuff and headed to the tender; with platinum, we can join the tender line without getting a ticket. We got on and off pretty quickly...maybe the first tender with the photographers on with us. I don't think we have ever scored the first tender before. Then to figure out which way to go; there was straight ahead and to the left. I finally decided on left, and they were there waiting for us. We picked our seats and settled in. When everyone was on board, our tour guide introduced herself. I don't remember her name...of course...but she had what sounded like a very interesting life. 

Isafjordur is connected to other parts of Iceland by two tunnels now. Both that we went through were about 5 km. The first was one lane part of the way. This required the south bound traffic (us for the first trip through) pulling off in the frequent pull off stops to let oncoming traffic pass. It does sound like a skill to know the speed that the oncoming traffic is coming versus where the next pull off is. The second tunnel was two way the full way. Here is a tunnel picture through mountains. Then prettiness back outside. 

On the way, we learned about the tunnels, now they are not allowed to build one lane tunnels. The sheep roam free all summer (marked for the farm that they belong to) and then for the winter the whole town works together and gathers them up to their correct barns. She talked about plants that she foraged for cooking, like thyme. After the tunnels, a bay with salmon farming that is controversial, and our guide talked about winter surfing in the bay with a show on NetFlix. I have since looked this up, not having NetFlix now; one was "surfing" in a kayak. I'm not sure if that is what she meant.

Then we arrived at the Dynjandi waterfall, with other waterfalls that also had names. It was so big. Our tour guide mentioned that we arrived before of the other tour buses, so we should get up there quickly. The bay behind the waterfall with the mountains was so pretty, so too many pictures of both. We hiked up to the waterfall. They had free restrooms at the bottom though hard to tell which were available, staggered sets behind each other.

Then we drove the length of the bay to the smallest of small towns to see the traditional sod roof houses. This was the Jon Sigurdsson Museum. The house was setup like they would have been. This was the cake stop. We shared a piece. It had jelly, but it was still very good. The other was called wedding cake, but ours was not that easy. Travis also had some tea. Our tour guide asked them to make her waffles; we did arrive to the port early so no time for breakfast beforehand. There was an additional museum and a Church with an old cemetery.

We could see the waterfall from here.

We found minke whales or a whale. See the fin in the bottom, center.

This bird, Artic tern, must have had a nest near, but it was trying to attack people that got too close.

{% image "images/P1120826.webp" %}

  


Also a waterfall at this stop.

We found another waterfall on the drive and a glacier in the mountains.

We got a picture of the wrapped hay bales. Also, a nice country side.

{% image "images/P1120839.webp" %}

  


Our last stop was a view of our ship. There was also a ski lift here.

So, for our tour guide's interesting life...she was a tour guide in the summer, did travel and cruise brochures photography, and worked on boats with scientist to tag animals and other related work (this one sounded really cold!). She also sailed with others to the east coast of Greenland where there are fewer towns and more rugged. She said that we will like Greenland much more than Iceland. 

  


Our guide have us a quick tour of the town, including the state run liquor store and then noted not open today since it was Sunday. I had read a recommendation due to the high alcohol tax to get it at the airport after landing. 

  


They had hot chocolate at the tender port. There was a line for the tender, but not bad. This started out looking like a cloudy day but turned out beautiful. 

  


Tonight was our Cagney's night. We used our free at sea meal of Cagney's, since before I had read it was easier to get sides than with the platinum certificate, and Cagney sides are important. It seems not true anymore and that sides would be include in the entrée. I was shocked that the free at sea dining was only one meal on a 10 night cruise. It has definitely been more before. I guess they are always offering it, so lots of people have it. 

  


Travis had oysters and beefsteak tomato, and I had the Caesar salad. The Caesar salad used to be my favorite in the MDR, but is not as good as it used to be. This one was high quality.

Travis's NY strip and sides: broccoli and barley risotto, and my petite filet with sides: onion rings and truffle, garlic mashed potatoes. So good, but so...much...food.
