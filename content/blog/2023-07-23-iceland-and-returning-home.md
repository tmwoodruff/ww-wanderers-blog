We docked in Reykjavik a day early. This would make our early flight easiest. The cruise line says not to book a flight before noon, and they book us a 9:30 am! However, that may be the time that most leave. Post office box at the port terminal. The port terminal was much less crowded now. They offered a complimentary shuttle. We walked in the morning, but took it in the afternoon. I wanted a license plate picture. We walked along the coast; it was a cloudy day. We looked at the ferry to the island, Videy, which was supposed to have birds. It was pretty expensive, and I felt that I had seen the island from the ship. I did not see any puffin that we needed to visit. We found the old leprosy hospital.

Then found the recycled house. Very cool and interesting. I looked up the film that the owner directed; you can learn about it at[ https://eurodrama.wordpress.com/2016/05/16/dvd-review-the-raven-flies-hrafninn-flygur/]( https://eurodrama.wordpress.com/2016/05/16/dvd-review-the-raven-flies-hrafninn-flygur/) and watched the preview...it does not look very good. It is from 1984, so special effect were not what they are today.

This partially underground building was also cool.

We talked through more of a neighborhood where people lived. This art was at the gym and sport complex. There were soccer games in progress. We walked through the botanical garden.

We found hot springs were ladies used to do laundry...to kill parasites on the clothes. I don't normally worry about parasites on our clothes, but maybe a real problem then before washers and dryers.

This was at the hot springs, down in the moat/run off. This scooter had a rough night.

Another similar in architecture church.

We were not in New Zealand, but I think we found Hobbiton.

I took the picture because the Stop sign said Stop in English.

On the walk back to the port, I think that gas, in liters, was expensive, but I'm not sure. Interesting pumps.

We went back in the afternoon, using the shuttle there and back. It dropped off/picked up at the Harpa. We wanted to pick up some snacks for the plane tomorrow.

Tonight was Moderno. My salad bar plate (when I remembered to take a picture) and two of Travis's. Big variety as normal.

After the salad bar, the sides arrived and the best (the meats are really good too) -- the Brazilian rolls. Toward the end of the meal, someone higher up, or someone who was not our waiter or a meat server, asked if we wanted anything else. I requested these, and he brought more -- yum! Travis has made them at home after we had them on NCL. The first time they were good but looked funny -- flat because they did not rise. The kids called them cheesy, rubbery rolls. Next attempts were great. Travis had the grilled pineapple; his favorite.

Travis had the Mango Rice Pudding, and I had the Tres leche for dessert. I'm not a big fan of soggy cake (or bread), but it was chocolate. So, I was not a big fan, but I ate some of the less soggy at the top. They were pretty.

We had arrive at the saddest day -- packing day. We went to bed early for the early flight. We were meeting Steve and Linda in the buffet before meeting up to catch the taxi. Since we were up early enough we did not haul or suitcases up to the buffet; I'm not sure if they did or not or planned for us too. After breakfast, we went back to the room, and NCL called those with their bags could disembark. I have seen these self-disembarks be crazy busy, so called Steve and said that we were going down since they called people. It was not busy at all; in fact, I saw some people disembarking with luggage the day before. We were planning to meet the taxi at 6am, but our taxi driver was there at 5:40am when we got off. We found him easily. He gave us some info about Iceland on the drive, which was interest. He had to learn Icelandic, Danish, and one other language of his choice in school. I think he said that Danish was not required anymore. He hated learning Danish. He pointed out the volcano smoke.

At the airport, it was confusing where to go, but we finally got to the right place. The signs showed that the gate would be posted later, but when posted, it was the same as on our ticket. There were long lines to get into the gate area, such that one could not tell which gate each line was for because the sign was at the beginning of the line, which was no where near the end of the line. People were being told to sit back down. Finally, we just got in line and waited. They were doing the security questions for some those that did not get them when checking bags. We already did it and had the stickers (on our passports -- geez) showing completion. 

When it was time for boarding, they were trying to call extra assistance and priority groups, which was difficult with the line system. Then people in our same group starting forming their own line. This time we had a jet bridge instead of outside stairs and bus. We got Travis an aisle seat for this flight for a daytime flight for sodas and restroom access, but an older lady talked him out of it, while I went to the restroom before the flight left, with the warning that he needed to get up a lot, though I think that I did more. Luckily, it was just over a 5 hour flight, shorter than others in Europe. Our connection was in Minneapolis-St. Paul, which we had never been to Minnesota, so new; the airport had cute, rugged, outdoor stores. 

Since I now had the window seat, I got to see some more beautiful Greenland. The pilot even mentioned it on the loud speaker. I captured more of the ice fields and then some nice mountains.
