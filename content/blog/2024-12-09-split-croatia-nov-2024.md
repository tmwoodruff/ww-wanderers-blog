**Exploring town and hiking in Forest Park Marjan - November 3, 2024**

We had a late arrival to today's port, so some nice sail in pictures with the Mediterranean Sea.

A visit to the bridge viewing room, deck 11, forward. This day the bridge windows were closed with a red zone alert sign up -- hopefully just for the sail in and docking, but they have screens that show location and traveling data like they have on the bridge that are cool to see.

We first checked out Split old and new town. There were many gates with names: Iron, Brass, Silver, and Golden Gates. Lots of history.

It was very pretty near the water. I like the palm trees.

These were the stairs that we started the hike up to the Forest Park Marjan. We got good views from the hill of water on both sides. There were many trails. There was also a botanical garden, but it did not seem open at any of the entrances/gates that we saw -- bummer.

Walking to and from the port, we walked through a ferry loading parking lot. These benches were cool; they had a solar panel to collect power and then allowed people to charge with contact or a usb port.

Travis climbed the rock wall while we waited for the sunset on the horizon to look for the green flash. Then it went behind a mountain before getting to the horizon, doh!

First night for MDR tonight; we only went to the Summer Palace MDR in the apt. We never make it to the Aqua MDR in the mid. Summer Palace opens earlier and is more elegant. Aqua is less formal with closer tables and noisier (from experience on other ships). I had the white cheddar and potato soup; lots of cheese make it good. For the main, I had the Hoki fish; it was not so good and a brownie s'mores that was very good. Travis had the Waldorf salad, Chicken Madeira, and bananas foster.
