**Walking the walls, old town, and fortress - November 4, 2024**

Arriving into port picture. We were docked far away from the old town. Only small ships can anchor near the old town and then tender to a small dock. This means that we had to take a bus ride to the old town. It was a little challenging to determine where to get a bus ticket. There was a larger bus/coach station inside the port area. I believe that these were long distance bus trips, not the local bus. However, here there was a store here that sold the local bus tickets where we brought a ticket from. I read before that bus tickets were cheaper pre-bought and more expensive bought on the bus. Later, we bought it on the bus to go back, and they were about the same. I also read that they only take Croatian Kuna (HRK), but everything was priced in EURs. The bus ride was about 15 minutes, and we arrived in old town.

There were blogs recommending the Walk the Walls entrances on the east side for less crowds, but the west side, near Pile Gate, was closer. The winter Walls ticket prices started on November 1st; $15 per person instead of $30 per person in the summer. So, I think that winter also reduced the crowds on the west side of the Walls. We were the only ones buying tickets at the time. The Walls took credit cards (something that I was trying to confirm for sure before we left) and charged in EURs. Another note is that they provide one restroom on the way; however, they don't tell you and there is no indication that there is only one restroom. We skipped it, fully expecting another before leaving; the old town and so the walls length were big (maybe they have additional during the summer). They will not let you back in (we tried an east entrance with our tickets) or go backwards/walking on the walls is one-way. I guess that would have been a plus of starting on the east; then thr restroom would be near the end. The original entrance guy that we talked try to send us to the paid restroom near the Hard Rock. This was the only disappointing part of Dubrovnik -- give us info about the _only_ restroom or put it on the ticket. Besides that, Dubrovnik was so beautiful and maybe my favorite -- with the Amalfi Coast. We did get to go to the restroom at the Fort. The Walls ticket covered the Walls, the Fort, and the Outer West Wall. More on those later. Walking the Walls entailed climbing stairs up to the top; the Walls were a fortress around the old town. Then walking all around the old town on the walls; there were still stairs up and down as the wall level changed. Recommendations that I heard were to walk them early before they were as crowded and as hot. Views from the Walls and looking down into the old town:

The views of the Mediterranean and Croatia's shore were stunning. This is the Fort -- Fort Lovrijenac.

Without a restroom break, we headed to the Fort. We stopped at two grocery stores looking for the recommended Croatian ham and cheese: paški Sir (Pag) cheese and pršut, a Croatian smoked ham. They were not very affordable and also the cheese not pre-sliced for an easy picnic. Instead we visited the Fort first, and then went back to the old town and found them in a sandwich at a restaurant. Some crazy trees outside the fort, views from the fort, and the sun getting lower early in the day. I complained about the early sunsets, making it dark and hiding the beautiful Mediterranean sea views, but we had wonder weather on this trip, so I cannot complain at all. It was supposed to get colder and rainy at the end of the trip, but it stayed nice.

After the fort (and restroom stop there), we walked along the water. There were fish, kayakers, and a cave in the wall.

Our sandwich was very good. It is the second one the menu below. The homemade bread was also very good.

The old town main street was so shiny. The stairs took us to the last attraction the Outer Western Walls.

They closed at 3pm; this was part of the cheaper winter price. We got there at 2:15pm. They asked what we were looking for and were disappointed that we were in the right place. He started to tell us that we did not have enough time and to leave, but we wanted to go through even if quickly. This was a really cool part of the "museum", but we did have to rush through. Later, we passed another guy, showing us where to exit was when we were done, so more rushing.   
  


{% image "images/IMG_0498.webp" %}

  


They had many displays, down and up stairs, inside; this is the foundry and cast house ruins. The museum did go off in many different directions, so one could have spend a lot of time there.

Back down, we caught the bus back to the port. Woman Bridge from the port area and from the ship. I called it Woman Bridge because Buenos Aires had a bridge that looked like it with that name. According to Google maps, it is really called: Dr. Franjo Tuđman Bridge. Almost as good of a name.

Here is the hard and with less favor NCL cookie that I was complaining about. They used to have such good cookies.

This night we had our dinner with the officers, so I did not take any food pictures with them there. We dined with the Assistant Guest Services Manager and Assistant Shore Excursions Manager. They were both from India. The Shore Excursions Manager started as a cook and then a waiter, so he knew the team in the MDR. We got very good service with them there and lots of attention. Apparently, we could have had a free drink too but did not know that. I had the pork pot stickers; they were very good. Then I had the Chicken Cordon Bleu that was not so good at first, but grew on me. I also tried the cannoli, which was also really good, but a challenge to eat with the hard pastry shell. Travis had Pasta e Fagioli soup, eggplant parmesan, and cannoli too.
